There are no reports about eye involvement in heat stroke. Here, we report a rare case of multilayered retinal haemorrhages in a patient with heatstroke. Case presentation: A 55-year-old male with a one-month history of blurry vision in both eyes presented at our department after suffering from heatstroke. His visual acuity was 5/20 OD and 10/20 OS. Fundus examination revealed retinal haemorrhages in both eyes. Fundus autofluorescence images and near-infrared reflectance images revealed well-defined retinal lesions. Optical coherence tomography helped to accurately locate the different layers of the lesions, including the nerve fiber layer, sub-inner limiting membrane, outer plexiform layer, ellipsoid zone and Henle fiber layer hemorrhages. We followed up with the patient for 8 months. At the last follow-up, his visual acuity was 20/20 in both eyes, and fundus examination showed that retinal hemorrhages were almost completely absorbed. Conclusion: To our knowledge, this is the first report on multilayered retinal hemorrhages secondary to heat stroke. Intraretinal and preretinal hemorrhages can gradually resolve, and the patient€™s vision will improve with the absorption of the retinal hemorrhages. Multimodal imaging may help to reveal additional details about retinal lesions and monitor the course of the disease.",Case report,1,NR,55,M,NR,Y,N,N,N,N,N,N,NR,N,N,Occupational,Outdoor work (3h),Outdoor Work,Outdoor Occupational (Physical Work/Labour/Agriculture Work/Farm Work),Outdoor Physical Work/Labour (Occupational),NR,3h,1905-07-14 00:00:00,40,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,39.8,Hospital/Clinic Admission,N,,,,NR,EHS,Acute retinal hemorrhages,Recovered,NR,,,,,,,,,,NR,N,,N,N,,N,N,,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,,,,,N,N,N,,N,N,,,N,N,,,,,N,N,,N,N,,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,,Y,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,,,,N,N,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,,,N,,N,,,,,Y,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,,N,N,,Y,N,,,,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,,,,,N,N,Y,N,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Y,N,N,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,,,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,159,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,,,111,59,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,,N,,N,15,10.6,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,,,,,,,,,1.26,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,,,N,,N,N,,,Y,,,,,,,,,N,,N,N,N,N,N,,,,,,N,,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,,N,Y,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,,N,N,,,,,,N,N,N,410,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,Y,N,,,,N,N,,,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,Y,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,N,Y,N,N,Y,Y,N,N,Y,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,Y,Y,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,,,,,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,,,,,N,N,N,N,,,N,,,,,,,N,N,,N,,,N,N,N,N,,,,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,,,,,,,,N,N,N,N,N,,,N,N,11.5,11.1,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,,,N,,N,N,N,,,N,,,,,,,,,,,N,N,,,,,,,,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,,,N,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,,,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,,,,,,N,,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,39.8

The diagnosis of heat stroke requires a high index of suspicion if the patient has been exposed to a high-temperature environment. Central nervous system dysfunction is a cardinal feature. Strict adherence to temperature criteria can potentially lead to misdiagnosis. Patient concerns: A 37-year-old construction worker was brought in by his wife and coworker due to a sudden loss of consciousness while resting after completing his work. Diagnoses: Due to challenges faced during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, as well as language barriers, a detailed history from the coworker who witnessed the patient's altered sensorium was not available. He was initially suspected of having encephalitis and brainstem stroke. However, subsequent investigations revealed multiorgan dysfunction with a normal brain computed tomography and cerebral computed tomography angiogram. In view of the multiple risk factors for heat stroke, pupillary constriction, and urine colour suggestive of rhabdomyolysis, a diagnosis of heat stroke was made. Interventions: Despite delayed diagnosis, the patient's multiorgan dysfunction recovered within days with basic supportive care. Outcomes: There were no noticeable complications on follow-up 14 months later. Lessons: Heat stroke can be easily confused with other neurological pathologies, particularly if no history can be obtained from the patient or informant. When approaching a comatose patient, we propose that serum creatinine kinase should be considered as an initial biochemical screening test.",Case report,1,NR,37,M,NR,N,"Headache, back pain and generalised weakness and no fever (1 day prior); Feeling of vague, indescribable discomfort, general malaise (day of incident)",N,N,N,N,N,NR,N,N,Occupational,Construction work (9h),Construction Work,Outdoor Occupational (Physical Work/Labour/Agriculture Work/Farm Work),Outdoor Physical Work/Labour (Occupational),NR,9h,2022-01-01 00:00:00,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,36.8,,,,,Hospital/Clinic Admission,N,,,,40,EHS,Nil,Recovered,NR,,,,,,,,,,NR,N,,N,N,,N,N,,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,Y,,Y,,,N,N,N,,N,N,,,N,N,,,,,N,N,,N,N,,10566,14334,,N,N,N,N,N,CK aNd CK-MB: DaY 2,Y,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,,,,N,N,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,,,N,,N,,,,,,N,Y,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,,N,N,,,Y,Y,,,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,Y,,,,Y,N,N,N,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,N,N,N,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,,,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,154,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,0.096,N,149,N,,,,,132,82,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,17.9,N,,N,,N,244,14.6,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,,,,,,,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,33.8,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,TropoNiN: DaY 3,N,N,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,,,Y,,N,N,,Y,,,,,,,,,,N,,N,N,N,N,N,,,,,,N,,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,,,Y,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,N,,,N,N,186,939,69,1494,,N,N,,N,N,,,,,,N,N,N,N,N,,N,14.54,N,N,N,N,N,,,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,,N,N,,,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,N,,N,N,Y,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,N,Y,Y,N,N,Y,N,N,N,N,Y,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,Y,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,,,,,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,,,,,N,N,N,N,,,N,,,,,,,N,N,,N,,,N,N,N,N,,,,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,,,,,,,,N,N,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,N,N,9,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,,,N,,Y,N,N,,,N,,,,,,,,,,,N,N,,,,,,,,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,Y,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,,,N,N,N,N,,,254.59,N,N,N,N,8.6,N,N,N,N,N,141,N,N,N,N,2.42,N,0.25,N,N,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,,,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,,,,,,N,,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,36.8

DOI: 10.1123/jsr.2022-0324",37290772,10.1123/jsr.2022-0324,"CONTEXT: Exertional heat stroke (EHS) is the most deadly form the exertional heat illness with a higher incidence among active duty US military members than in the general population. Current guidelines on EHS recovery timelines and return to duty vary among the military branches. In some cases, individuals experience prolonged heat and exercise intolerance with repeat exertional heat illness events, which can complicate the recovery process. Management and rehabilitation of such individuals is unclear. CASE PRESENTATION: This manuscript addresses the case and management of a US Air Force Special Warfare trainee who experienced 2 episodes of EHS, despite early recognition, gold standard treatment, and undergoing 4 weeks of a stepwise recovery after an initial EHS. MANAGEMENT AND OUTCOMES: After the second episode, a 3-step process was utilized, consisting of a prolonged and personalized recovery period, heat tolerance testing using Israeli Defense Force advanced modelling, and stepwise reacclimatization.

DOI: 10.1123/jsr.2022-0324",37290772,10.1123/jsr.2022-0324,"CONTEXT: Exertional heat stroke (EHS) is the most deadly form the exertional heat illness with a higher incidence among active duty US military members than in the general population. Current guidelines on EHS recovery timelines and return to duty vary among the military branches. In some cases, individuals experience prolonged heat and exercise intolerance with repeat exertional heat illness events, which can complicate the recovery process. Management and rehabilitation of such individuals is unclear. CASE PRESENTATION: This manuscript addresses the case and management of a US Air Force Special Warfare trainee who experienced 2 episodes of EHS, despite early recognition, gold standard treatment, and undergoing 4 weeks of a stepwise recovery after an initial EHS. MANAGEMENT AND OUTCOMES: After the second episode, a 3-step process was utilized, consisting of a prolonged and personalized recovery period, heat tolerance testing using Israeli Defense Force advanced modelling, and stepwise reacclimatization. This process allowed the trainee to successfully recover from repeat EHS and return to duty, and set a framework for future repeat EHS treatment guidelines. CONCLUSIONS: In individuals with repeat EHS, a prolonged recovery period followed by heat tolerance testing can be used to demonstrate appropriate thermotolerance and safely clear an individual to begin stepwise reacclimatization.

DOI: 10.23750/abm.v94iS1.14917",37606057,10.23750/abm.v94iS1.14917,"We report the case of a 52-year-old marathon runner admitted to our emergency department for exertional heat stroke (EHS). The electrocardiogram (ECG) showed a supraventricular tachycardia, probably an atrial flutter with a 2:1 block, conducted with a left bundle branch block. After 10 minutes of aggressive fluid management and rapid external cooling, the ECG returned to normal. As the high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I was elevated, coronary angiography and an electrophysiological study were performed, revealing normal coronary arteries, and excluding inducible arrhythmias. As reported in the current literature, our findings confirm that the electrocardiographic changes and elevation of cardiac markers in EHS do not reflect cardiac ischemia, but rather a myocardial injury due to the pathophysiological response to dehydration and hyperthermia, which markedly impaired stroke volume and cardiac output. EHS is a life-threatening condition with a complex pathophysiology caused by thermoregulatory failure. Diagnosis is not always straightforward, but early recognition and timely management (the â€œgolden hourâ€) with rapid cooling and intravenous fluids are crucial to prevent irreversible and fatal organ damage. EHS is defined by a rectal temperature > 40.5 Â°C with symptoms or signs of neurological dysfunction, such as confusion, drowsiness, or seizures, which can rapidly worsen with delirium, coma, and cardiac arrest. With this case report, we want to remind emergency physicians that early diagnosis and appropriate management of EHS can avoid death and inappropriate treatment.

We present a novel case of compassionate use of Seraph filter in a young, healthy active duty service member with heat injury-induced massive inflammatory response. The patient is a previously healthy 26-year-old male with altered mental status, tachycardia, fever to 40.3 Â°C, and hypotension after losing consciousness during a 4-mile run. He had a history of one heat injury in college and took no medications or supplements. Initial workup demonstrated hemoconcentration, leukocytosis, and hyperkalemia. He was intubated, received isotonic crystalloid fluid, and was admitted to the intensive care unit. The patient developed vasopressor-resistant shock and multiorgan failure with rhabdomyolysis requiring continuous renal replacement therapy. The addition of the Seraph resulted in improved hemodynamic stability, decreased inflammatory markers, and improved organ function. Approximately 1 week after the final Seraph treatment, the patient had an abrupt massive lower gastrointestinal bleed and was transitioned to comfort care by family. We present the novel use of Seraph in the setting of multiorgan failure and hyperinflammatory state due to heat injury. The patient's vasopressor refractory distributive shock was believed to be secondary to heat stroke-induced massive inflammatory response, leading to a trial of Seraph therapy.

The objective of this study was to determine whether algorithms that estimate Tcr from heart rate and gait instability from a trunk-worn sensor system can forward predict EHS onset. METHODS: Heart rate and three-axis accelerometry data were collected from chest-worn sensors from 1806 US military personnel participating in timed 4/5-mile runs, and loaded marches of 7 and 12 miles; in total, 3422 high EHS-risk training datasets were available for analysis. Six soldiers were diagnosed with heat stroke and all had rectal temperatures of >41Â°C when first measured and were exhibiting CNS dysfunction. Estimated core temperature (ECTemp) was computed from sequential measures of heart rate. Gait instability was computed from three-axis accelerometry using features of pattern dispersion and autocorrelation. RESULTS: The six soldiers who experienced heat stroke were among the hottest compared with the other soldiers in the respective training events with ECTemps ranging from 39.2Â°C to 40.8Â°C.

The objective of this study was to determine whether algorithms that estimate Tcr from heart rate and gait instability from a trunk-worn sensor system can forward predict EHS onset. METHODS: Heart rate and three-axis accelerometry data were collected from chest-worn sensors from 1806 US military personnel participating in timed 4/5-mile runs, and loaded marches of 7 and 12 miles; in total, 3422 high EHS-risk training datasets were available for analysis. Six soldiers were diagnosed with heat stroke and all had rectal temperatures of >41Â°C when first measured and were exhibiting CNS dysfunction. Estimated core temperature (ECTemp) was computed from sequential measures of heart rate. Gait instability was computed from three-axis accelerometry using features of pattern dispersion and autocorrelation.

The objective of this study was to determine whether algorithms that estimate Tcr from heart rate and gait instability from a trunk-worn sensor system can forward predict EHS onset. METHODS: Heart rate and three-axis accelerometry data were collected from chest-worn sensors from 1806 US military personnel participating in timed 4/5-mile runs, and loaded marches of 7 and 12 miles; in total, 3422 high EHS-risk training datasets were available for analysis. Six soldiers were diagnosed with heat stroke and all had rectal temperatures of >41Â°C when first measured and were exhibiting CNS dysfunction. Estimated core temperature (ECTemp) was computed from sequential measures of heart rate. Gait instability was computed from three-axis accelerometry using features of pattern dispersion and autocorrelation. RESULTS: The six soldiers who experienced heat stroke were among the hottest compared with the other soldiers in the respective training events with ECTemps ranging from 39.2Â°C to 40.8Â°C. Combining ECTemp and gait instability measures successfully identified all six EHS casualties at least 3.5 min in advance of collapse while falsely identifying 6.1% (209 total false positives) examples where exertional heat illness symptoms were neither observed nor reported.

Results Versus successful finishers, EHI showed significantly higher NSE (10.33 [6.37, 20.00] vs. 3.17 [2.71, 3.92] ug.L-1, P<0.0001), cysC (1.48 [1.10, 1.67] vs. 1.10 [0.95, 1.21] mg.L-1, P = 0.0092) and copeptin (339.4 [77.0, 943] vs. 18.7 [7.1, 67.9] pmol.L-1, P = 0.0050).

DOI: 10.1136/bmjmilitary-2019-001356",32434882,10.1136/bmjmilitary-2019-001356,"INTRODUCTION: Over recent years much research, both civilian and military, has occurred in the field of heat illness. This has helped force health protection and medical management of service personnel operating in hot climates. Exercise Saif Sareea 3 in Oman saw a collection of presentations to the deployed UK medical treatment facilities due to the effects of heat. METHOD: This paper aims to describe the case series of 24 casualties that presented to the deployed primary care facilities and 17 that were admitted to the deployed secondary care facility due to the effects of heat. RESULTS: Only 10 casualties fulfilled the in-theatre diagnostic criteria for heat illness, of which two were of moderate severity and required aeromedical evacuation to the UK.

JSP539 did, however, appear to have some limitations when trying to apply it to all patients seen within the operational patient care pathway, and some areas for development are discussed.",Case series,5,NR,26.9,NR,26.1,Y,N,N,N,N,N,N,Overweight,N,N,Occupational,Annual fitness test (NR),Mixed Activities (Fitness Test),Occupational (Training/Test/Exercise/Course),Military Training (Occupational),NR,NR,Oct 2018,,,,,,,,,,,,,,37.4,,,,,,,Pre-Treatment,Y,37.4,Tympanic,Hospital admission,40,EHI,Nil,NR,NR,,,,,,,,,,NR,N,,N,N,,N,N,,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,,,,,N,N,N,,N,N,,,N,N,,,,,N,N,,N,N,,155,N,,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,,,,N,N,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,,,N,,N,,,,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,,N,N,,,N,,,,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,,,,,N,N,N,N,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,N,N,N,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,,,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,,,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,,,,,,,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,,,N,,N,N,,,,,,,,,,,,N,,N,N,N,N,N,,,,,,N,,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,,N,N,,,,,,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,,N,N,,,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,Y,N,N,N,Y,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,,,,,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,,,,,N,N,N,N,,,N,,,,,,,N,N,,N,,,N,N,N,N,,,,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,,,,,,,,N,N,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,N,N,14,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,,,N,,N,N,N,,,N,,,,,,,,,,,N,N,,,,,,,,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,,,N,N,N,N,,,88.4,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,141,4,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,,,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,,,,,,N,,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,37.4

Heatstroke is a medical emergency with multiple organ involvement and life-threatening illness with a high mortality rate of up to 71%. Uncontrolled damage to the central nervous system can result in severe cerebral edema, permanent neurological sequelae, and death. However, regarding the therapeutic aspects of heat stroke, there was no therapeutic strategy after the rapid cooling of the core body temperature to <39Â°C to prevent further injury.Patient concerns:Each of 3 patients developed a change of mental statuses after the exposure to summer heatwaves or relatively high environmental temperatures with high humidity in the sauna.Diagnoses:The patients were diagnosed with severe heatstroke since they showed cerebral edema and multiple organ dysfunction based on the results from laboratory tests and the findings in brain computed tomography scan.Interventions:The patients underwent induced therapeutic hypothermia (<36Â°C) between 24 and 36 hours in the management of severe heatstroke.Outcomes:The patients survived from cerebral edema and multiple organ dysfunction.Lessons:We believe that targeted temperature management (<36Â°C) will help treat severe heatstroke.

Nevertheless, data evaluating the course of making an EHS diagnosis in real-life practice, as well as the role of predisposing psychological components are limited. Thus, the aim of our study was to present a multi-faceted differentiation process and show the role of unhealthy competition in the development of EHS. We describe a case of a young amateur runner, admitted to the hospital due to loss of consciousness, further mental confusion, and increased body temperature above 40Â°C. Head scans excluded brain haemorrhage and stroke. Elevated troponin I levels suggested an acute coronary syndrome (ACS) or myocarditis. An increase of procalcitonin levels, signs of rhabdomyolysis and severe liver injury resulted in evaluation for infection and acute hepatic damage. Subsequently, the patient's negative results pointed us to a diagnosis of EHS. In-depth anamnesis revealed that the patient's excessive effort during the race was linked to the male-female competition. EHS can present diagnostic challenges, as it mimics various diseases, such as stroke, myocarditis, ACS, infection, or liver dysfunction.

We present a case of EHS in a service-member (SM) resulting in acute liver failure (ALF). CASE DESCRIPTION/METHODS: A 34 year-old SM with a past medical history significant for severe alcohol use disorder who presented with EHS after going on a 3-mile unit run in 'boots and utes.' The SM was noted to have slurred speech and confusion afterwards prompting a visit to the ED. On initial evaluation he was noted to be obtunded with hypotension, tachycardia and a core temperature of 104o F. Following initial care with external cooling, the SM was transferred to our ICU and began to show signs of multi-organ dysfunction including acute encephalopathy, myocardial injury, acute kidney injury (AKI), anion gap metabolic acidosis, rhabdomyolysis, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and fulminant liver failure with AST/ALT of 16,400/4,820 respectively. Recognition of ALF secondary to EHS prompted our care team to refer the SM to a liver transplant center to be evaluated for an orthotropic liver transplant. DISCUSSION: According to the Armed Forces Health Surveillance Branch's annual update, 12,361 service members were reported to have heat related illness in 250 US military installations worldwide. Our case presents a SM with multiple risk factors for EHS including chronic alcohol use and deconditioning during the COVID-19 pandemic that lead to the development of ALF despite prompt diagnosis and treatment. Of note, literature review states that âˆ¼5% of heat stroke casualties experience ALF. Pathogenesis of ALF is thought to be secondary to a combination of direct thermal injury, gut ischemia from shunting of blood to the periphery and an inflammatory response from bacterial toxins translocated from the ischemic gut. Multiple prognostic risk assessments are used including the Model for End stage Liver Disease (MELD) and King's College Criteria to assess benefits of liver transplant. Our patient, despite only fulfilling 2 of 4 of the King's College Criteria, had a MELD score of 39 indicating a 52.6% 3-month mortality indicating a need for liver transplant.",Case report,1,NR,34,NR,NR,Y,N,Alcohol use disorder,N,N,N,N,NR,N,N,Occupational,Unit run 4.8km (completed),Run,Occupational (Training/Test/Exercise/Course),Military Training (Occupational),4.82802,NR,NR,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,40,Pre-Treatment,N,,,,NR,EHS,Multi-organ dysfunction,NR,NR,,,,,,,,,,NR,N,,N,N,,N,N,,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,Y,,,,,N,N,N,,N,N,,,N,N,,,,,N,N,,N,N,,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,,Y,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,,,,N,N,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,,,N,,N,,,,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,Y,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,,Y,N,,,N,,,,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,Y,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,,,,,N,N,N,N,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,N,N,N,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,,,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,,,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,,,,,,,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,,,Y,,N,N,,,,,,,,,,,,N,,N,N,N,N,N,,,,,,N,,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,16400,N,4820,,N,N,,N,N,,,,,,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,,N,N,,,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,N,,N,Y,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,N,N,Y,N,N,N,N,N,Y,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,,,,,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,,,,,N,N,N,N,,,N,,,,,,,N,N,,N,,,N,N,N,N,,,,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,,,,,,,,N,N,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,,,N,,Y,N,N,,,N,,,,,,,,,,,N,N,,,,,,,,,,Y,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,,,N,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,,,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,,,,,,N,,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,40.0

Radiologic diagnosis of the condition is challenging because not every patient with clinical deficits shows abnormalities in computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging. In this case review, we report a patient who had been diagnosed with a severe heat stroke and showed gait disturbance, language disorder, and cognitive impairment although conventional magnetic resonance imaging did not reveal significant findings that correlated with his symptoms. Diffusion tensor tractography has been reported to be a useful tool for evaluating the neural status of white matter tracts across a wide range of conditions. The corticospinal tract, the corticoreticular pathway, the cingulum, the fornix, the medial lemniscus, and the arcuate fasciculus of the patient were reconstructed using diffusion tensor tractography. A narrowing, discontinuation, and decreased fractional anisotropy and fiber volume of the examined neural tracts were observed, which correlated well with his symptoms. These results suggest that diffusion tensor tractography might be a useful tool for the detection of neurologic deficits even when conventional brain magnetic resonance imaging reveals no significant abnormality and in establishing appropriate rehabilitation strategies for patients with neurologic symptoms after a heat stroke.",Case report,1,NR,43,M,NR,Y,N,N,N,N,N,N,NR,N,N,Occupational,Courier work (NR),Courier Work,Outdoor Occupational (Physical Work/Labour/Agriculture Work/Farm Work),Outdoor Physical Work/Labour (Occupational),NR,NR,1905-07-10 00:00:00,37.3,80.9,36.088668049414025,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,42.1,Pre-Treatment,N,,,,40,EHS,Nil,Recovered,NR,,,,,,,,,,NR,N,,N,N,,N,N,,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,Y,N,N,,N,N,Y,,,,,N,N,N,,N,N,,,N,N,,,,,N,N,,N,N,,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,,,,N,N,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,,,N,,N,,,,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,,N,N,,,N,,,,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,,,,,N,N,N,N,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,N,N,N,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,,,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,,,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,,,,,,,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,,,N,,N,N,,,,,,,,,,,,N,,N,N,N,N,N,,,,,,N,,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,,N,N,,,,,,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,,N,N,,,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,,N,N,N,Y,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,Y,N,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,N,Y,Y,N,N,Y,N,N,Y,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,Y,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,Y,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,,,,,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,,,,,N,N,N,N,,,N,,,,,,,Y,N,,N,,,N,N,N,N,,,,Y,,Y,Y,N,N,N,N,,,,,,,,,,N,N,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,N,N,3,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,,,N,"Neural iNjurY

We present a case of heat stroke resulting in acute liver injury (ALI) successfully treated with intravenous N-acetylcysteine (NAC). Case presentation: A 24-year-old unresponsive male without significant past medical history presented to the emergency department with heat stroke; his initial temperature was 107.4 Â°F. During his hospital course, he developed ALI with significant elevation in aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, and total bilirubin. These laboratory findings peaked by hospital day two, but improved prior to discharge on hospital day five and throughout his follow up clinic visits. His treatment course included cooling measures, supportive care, supplemental oxygen and airway management, seizure control, and intravenous NAC therapy.

DOI: 10.1097/JNN.0000000000000488",31842028,10.1097/JNN.0000000000000488,"BACKGROUND: Exertional heat stroke (EHS) is defined by a core body temperature that exceeds 40Â°C with associated central nervous system dysfunction, skeletal muscle injury, and multiple organ damage. The most important initial focus of treatment involves reduction of patient temperature. First approaches to achieve temperature reduction often include ice packs, water blankets, and cold intravenous fluid administration. When these measures fail, more advanced temperature management methods may be deployed but often require surgical expertise. Esophageal temperature management (ETM) has recently emerged as a new temperature management modality in which an esophageal heat transfer device replaces the standard orogastric tube routinely placed after endotracheal intubation and adds a temperature modulation capability. The objective of this case study is to report the first known use of ETM driven by bedside nursing staff in the treatment of EHS. METHOD: An ETM device was placed after endotracheal intubation in a 28-year-old man experiencing EHS over a 5-day course of treatment. RESULTS: Because the ETM device was left in place, when the patient experienced episodes of increasing temperature as high as 39.1Â°C, which required active cooling, nursing staff were able to immediately adjust the external heat exchange unit settings to achieve aggressive cooling at bedside. CONCLUSION: This nurse-driven technology offers a new means to rapidly deploy cooling to critically ill patients without needing to implement advanced surgical approaches or obstruct access to the patient, freeing the provider to continue optimal care in high-morbidity conditions.",Case report,1,NR,28,M,NR,Y,Muscle cramps (1 day prior),N,N,N,N,N,NR,N,N,Occupational,Firefighter training programme [uphill hike] (NR),Hike,Occupational (Training/Test/Exercise/Course),Training/Exercise (Occupational),NR,NR,1905-07-11 00:00:00,26.6667,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,41.7,Pre-Treatment,Y,40,Unspecified,Hospital admission,40,EHS,Encelphalopathy and rhabdomyolysis,Recovered,NR,,,,,,,,,,NR,N,,N,N,,N,N,,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,Y,,Y,,,N,N,N,,N,N,,,N,N,,,,,N,N,,N,N,,155,1326,,N,N,N,N,N,peak CK: DaY Not reported,Y,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,,,,N,N,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,,,N,,N,,,,,,N,N,N,N,N,Y,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,,N,N,,,N,,,,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,,,,,N,N,N,N,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Y,N,N,,,,,,,,,,,,,Y,,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,Y,N,,N,N,N,N,,,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,150,N,N,N,N,N,N,320,N,N,N,N,N,,,,,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,,N,,N,51,N,N,N,N,N,,198,N,N,N,,,,,,,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,1.94,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,,,Y,,N,N,,Y,,,,,,,,,,N,,N,N,N,N,N,,,,,,N,,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,Y,N,N,,,N,N,N,N,,,N,N,38,>600,49,>600,,N,N,,79,N,,,,,,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,,N,N,,,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,,N,N,N,Y,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,N,,N,Y,Y,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,N,Y,Y,N,N,Y,N,N,Y,N,N,Y,N,N,N,N,N,Y,Y,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,,,,,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,,,,,N,N,N,N,,,N,,,,,,,N,N,,N,,,N,N,N,N,,,,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,,,,,,,,N,N,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,,,N,,Y,N,N,,,N,,,,,,,,,,,N,N,,,,,,,,,,N,N,N,N,Y,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,,,N,N,N,N,,,197.13,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,141,5.4,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,,,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,,,,,,N,,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,41.7

DOI: 10.1155/2020/1305730",32089909,10.1155/2020/1305730,"Heat stroke (HS) is a condition characterized by a rise in core body temperature and central nervous system dysfunction. It is divided into two types: classical and exertional. Exertional heat stroke (EHS) is accompanied by organ failure. Liver injury, presenting only with a rise in liver enzymes, is common but in rare conditions, acute liver failure (ALF) may ensue, leading to a potentially lethal condition. Most cases of EHS-induced ALF are managed conservatively. However, liver transplantation is considered for cases refractory to supportive treatment. Identifying patients eligible for liver transplantation in the context of an EHS-induced ALF becomes a medical dilemma since the conventional prognostic criterion may be difficult to apply, and there is paucity of literature about these specific sets of individuals. Recently, extracorporeal liver support has been gaining popularity for patients with liver failure as a bridge to liver transplant. In this case report, we present a young Filipino athlete with symptoms and clinical course consistent with EHS that developed multiorgan failure, initially considered a candidate for liver transplant and total plasma exchange, but clinically improved with supportive management alone. This patient was also found to have bimodal rhabdomyolysis during the course of his hospital stay as manifested by the bimodal rise in his creatine kinase enzymes.",Case report,1,NR,27,M,NR,Y,Recent Gastroenteritis (not specified),N,N,N,N,N,NR,N,N,Recreational,Run 6.8km (completed),Run,Recreational (Physical Activity/Training/Exercise),Physical Activity/Sport (Recreational),6.8,NR,2019-03-01 00:00:00,34,,,,,,,,,,,,,40.2,,,,,,,Pre-Treatment,N,,,,40,EHS,Multiorgan failure with bimodal rhabdomyolysis,Recovered,NR,,,,,,,,,,NR,N,,N,N,,N,N,,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,Y,,Y,,,N,N,N,,N,N,,,N,N,,,,,N,N,,N,N,,312,24309,,N,N,N,N,N,peak CK: DaY 4,Y,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,,,,N,N,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,,,N,,N,,,,,,N,Y,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,,Y,Y,,Y,N,,,,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,Y,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,,,,,N,N,N,N,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,N,N,N,,,,,,,,,,,,,Y,,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,Y,N,,N,N,N,N,Y,,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,162,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,60,N,,,,,70,40,,N,N,7.406,98,N,29.5,84.2,N,N,N,N,18.7,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,113.2,N,N,N,,,,,,,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,31,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,1.61,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,,,Y,,N,N,,Y,,,,,,,,,,N,,N,N,N,N,N,,,,,,N,,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,N,,,N,N,436,4743,336,8287,,N,N,,N,N,,,,,,N,N,N,N,N,,N,136.12,395.35,N,N,N,N,,,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,,Y,N,,,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,N,N,30,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,N,Y,Y,N,N,Y,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,Y,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,,,,,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,,,,,N,N,N,N,,,N,,,,,,,N,N,,N,,,N,N,N,N,,,,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,,,,,,,,N,N,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,N,N,7,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,,,N,,Y,N,N,,,N,,,,,,,,,,,N,N,,,,,,,,,,Y,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,Y,N,Y,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,,,N,N,N,N,,,160.2,N,51,N,N,32.21,N,N,393,>6000,N,144,5.1,N,N,N,4.6,N,N,N,N,1.62,N,N,,,N,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,,,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,,,,,,N,,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,40.2

Mild to moderate hepatocellular injury is a well-documented complication but severe liver injury and acute liver failure are rare. There are neither established criteria nor optimal timing for liver transplantation and conservative management seems to be the cornerstone treatment. The authors report a case of a patient with severe liver injury related to HS who recovered completely under conservative treatment. LEARNING POINTS â€¢ Hyperthermia, neurologic dysfunction and recent exposure to hot weather or physical exertion should raise the suspicion of heat stroke (HS). â€¢ Fast and effective cooling is the cornerstone of treatment, along with support of organ dysfunction. Antipyretics have no role in HS management. â€¢ Conservative treatment has been described as being successful in the management of patients with HS that manifest severe acute liver injury (ALI) and acute liver failure (ALF).

Moreover, it is extremely rare in the very young without risk factors. This paper presents a patient with ischemic colitis associated with heat stroke and rhabdomyolysis after intense exercise under high-temperature conditions. A 20-year-old man presented with mental deterioration after a vigorous soccer game for more than 30 minutes in sweltering weather. He also presented with hematochezia with abdominal pain. The laboratory tests revealed the following: AST 515 U/L, ALT 269 U/L, creatine kinase 23,181 U/L, BUN 29.1 mg/dL, creatinine 1.55 mg/dL, and red blood cell >50/high-power field in urine analysis.

Methods of cooling include cold water immersion, ice packs, cold water lavage, and chilled saline, among others. We report a case of EHS successfully cooled using an endovascular cooling device after traditional cooling methods failed to reduce core body temperature. Case Report: A 24-year old soldier collapsed during a 12-mile foot march while training in southern Georgia. His initial rectal temperature was 43.1Â°C (109.6Â°F). External cooling measures (ice sheet application) were initiated on site and Emergency Medical Services were called to transport to the hospital. Paramedics obtained a repeat rectal temperature of 42.4Â°C (108.4Â°F). Ice sheet application and chilled saline infusion were continued throughout transport to the Emergency Department (ED). Total prehospital treatment time was 50 min. Upon ED arrival, the patient's rectal temperature was 41.2Â°C (106.2Â°F). He was intubated due to a Glasgow Coma Scale score of 4, and endovascular cooling was initiated. Less than 45 minutes later his core body temperature was 37.55Â°C (99.6Â°F). He was admitted to the intensive care unit, where his mental status rapidly improved. He was found to have rising liver enzymes, and there was concern for his developing disseminated intravascular coagulation, prompting transfer to a tertiary care center. He was subsequently discharged from the hospital 14 days after his initial injury without any persistent sequelae. Why Should an Emergency Physician Be Aware of This?: The primary treatment for EHS is rapid reduction of core body temperature. When external cooling methods fail, endovascular cooling can be used to rapidly decrease core body temperature.",Case report,1,NR,24,M,27.7,Y,N,N,N,N,N,N,Overweight,N,N,Occupational,Foot march [18.2kg/40lb load] 19.3km (completed),March,Occupational (Training/Test/Exercise/Course),Military Training (Occupational),19.31208,NR,Apr-Nov 2017,,,,,,,,,,43.1,,,,,,,,,,,Pre-Treatment,Y,42.4,Rectal,Post-initial treatment,40,EHS,Acute liver injury,Recovered,NR,,,,,,,,,,NR,N,,N,N,,N,N,,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,Y,,Y,,,N,N,N,,N,N,,,N,N,,,,,N,N,,N,N,,3804,20000,,N,N,107,N,N,peak CK: DaY Not reported,Y,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,,,,N,N,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,,,N,,N,,,,,Y,N,N,N,N,N,Y,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,,N,Y,,Y,N,,,,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,Y,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,Y,,,,N,N,N,N,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,N,Y,N,,,,,,,,,,,,,Y,,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,,,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,149,N,N,N,N,N,N,108,N,N,N,N,N,,,,,93,54,,N,N,N,100,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,,,,,,,,,>5000,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,53,N,N,,N,1.75,N,N,N,N,N,4.29,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,,,Y,,N,N,,Y,,,,,,,,,,N,,N,N,N,N,N,,,,,,N,,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,N,,,N,N,91,6687,32,4979,,N,N,,N,N,,,,,,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,,N,N,,,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,N,Y,Y,N,N,Y,N,N,Y,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,Y,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,,,,,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,,,,,N,N,N,N,,,N,,,,,,,N,N,,N,,,N,N,N,N,,,,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,,,,,,,,N,N,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,N,N,4,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,,,N,,Y,N,N,,,N,,,,,,,,,,,N,N,,,,,,,,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,,,N,N,N,N,,,212.16,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,Y,N,,,,,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,,,,,,N,,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,43.1

Brain lesions in patients with HS who present with CNS damage have been rarely reported before, and they usually vary in different cases, hence, patients with such lesions may present a clinical challenge in terms of diagnosis and management. Cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT) is a rare cause of stroke that mostly affects young individuals and children. The pathogenesis of brain damage caused by HS is complex, and CVT may be involved in the pathogenesis of HS with CNS damage. In this manuscript, we have reported a case of a patient with HS having CVT with symmetrical lesions in the bilateral putamen, posterior limb of the internal capsule, external capsule, insular lobe, and subcortical white matter in the brain. Case presentation: We encountered a 48-year-old man who presented with HS in the summer season. During admission, he had a high body temperature and was in coma and shock. Then, he developed rhabdomyolysis syndrome, acute kidney and liver damage, electrolyte imbalance, and acid-base balance disorders, and his D-dimer level was elevated. After several days of anti-shock treatment, the patient's level of consciousness improved. However, he experienced a decline in vision. Cerebral magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed symmetrical lesions in the bilateral posterior limb of the internal capsule, putamen, external capsule, insula, and subcortical white matter, and cerebral magnetic resonance venography (MRV) showed the development of CVT. Therefore, anti-coagulation treatment was provided. After timely clinical intervention, the symptoms of the patient gradually improved. Conclusions: This case showed that HS can cause CVT. Therefore, cerebral MRI findings in HS must be assessed; in addition, early MRV can help in the diagnosis of the disease, which can effectively improve prognosis.",Case report,1,NR,48,M,NR,Y,N,N,N,N,N,N,NR,N,N,Occupational,Outdoor work (2h),Physical Work/Labour,Outdoor Occupational (Physical Work/Labour/Agriculture Work/Farm Work),Outdoor Physical Work (Occupational),NR,2h,2018-07-01 00:00:00,35,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,40.2,Hospital/Clinic Admission,N,,,,40,EHS,"Rhabdomyolysis syndrome, acute kidney injury, hepatic disfunction, hyperkalemia, and metabolic acidosis",Recovered,NR,,,,,,,,,,NR,N,,N,N,,N,N,,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,Y,,,,,N,N,N,,N,N,,,N,N,,,,,N,N,,N,N,,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,,Y,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,,,,N,N,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,,,N,,N,,,,,Y,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,,Y,Y,,Y,N,,,,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,,,,,N,N,N,N,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,N,N,N,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,Y,,N,N,N,N,,,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,100,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,,,75,40,,N,N,N,95,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,,,,,,,,,1.022,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,,,Y,,N,N,,,,,,,,,,,,N,,N,N,N,N,N,,,,,,N,,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,Y,Y,,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,,N,N,,,,,,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,Y,N,,,,N,N,,,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,Y,N,Y,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,N,Y,N,N,N,Y,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,Y,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,,,,,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,,,,,N,N,N,N,,Y,N,,,,,,,N,N,,N,,,N,N,N,N,,,,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,,,,,,,,N,N,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,210,1.87,N,N,N,N,,,,,267,"Neural iNjurY:

However, treatment strategies for DIC in heat stroke have not yet been established, and also, the time course changes in coagulofibrinolytic markers have not been thoroughly evaluated. We report a severe heat stroke case with DIC who was eventually saved by anti-DIC treatments in accordance with changes in coagulofibrinolytic markers. Case presentation: A 45-year-old man was found unconscious outside, and his body temperature was elevated to 41.9 Â°C. For heat stroke, we performed an immediate tracheal intubation under the general anesthesia along with cooling by iced gastric lavage, cold fluid administration, and an intravascular cooling using Thermogardâ„¢. About 4 h after admission, his core temperature fell to 37 Â°C. We assessed coagulofibrinolytic biomarkers and treated in accordance with changes in these parameters. This case exhibited a biphasic change varying from an enhanced to a suppressed fibrinolytic type of DIC depending on the relative balance between fibrinolytic activation and the level of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1). In the early phase with consumption coagulopathy and enhanced fibrinolysis, we transfused a large amount of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) and platelets with tranexamic acid, an antifibrinolytic agent, possibly providing relief for the bleeding tendency. Anticoagulant therapy using recombinant human thrombomodulin-Î± (rh-TM-Î±) and antithrombin III (ATIII) concentrate was especially effective for DIC with a suppressed fibrinolytic phenotype in the later phase, after which organ failure that included severe hepatic failure was remarkably improved.

In this context, the resulting fulminant hepatic failure makes liver transplant the best choice when there are no guarantees of better results with conservative treatment. We present our experience in this case, possible alternative choices, and the current role of liver transplantation in the resolution of fulminant liver failure due to heat stroke. Case Report: We report the case of a 32-year-old man with a history of malabsorption syndrome and unconfirmed celiac disease controlled with a gluten-free diet, who, while working on a typical summer midday in southern Spain (approximately 40Â°C), abruptly presented with loss of consciousness, coma, and a temperature of 42Â°C, as well as seizures at the initial medical assessment that subsided after the administration of diazepam. On the third day, the patient presented with multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, requiring mechanical ventilation, hemodialysis, and inotropic support. He did not improve with the support of conservative treatment, therefore it was decided to perform an urgent liver transplant, after which he recovered completely. Conclusions: Liver transplantation should be a main choice of treatment for cases in which, despite intensive medical treatment, there is still clinical and analytical evidence of massive and/or irreversible hepatocellular damage.",Case Report,1,NR,32,M,NR,Y,N,Malabsorption Syndrome; Unconfirmed Celiac Disease,N,N,N,N,NR,N,N,Occupational,Delivering goods (NR),Physical Work/Labour,Outdoor Occupational (Physical Work/Labour/Agriculture Work/Farm Work),Outdoor Physical Work (Occupational),NR,NR,Summer 2018,40,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,42,Hospital/Clinic Admission,N,,,,40,EHS,Metabolic acidosis with progressive loss of liver function,Recovered,NR,,,,,,,,,,NR,N,,N,N,,N,N,,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,,,,,N,N,N,,N,N,,,N,N,,,,,N,N,,N,N,,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,,,,N,N,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,,,N,,N,,,,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,,N,N,,,N,,,,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,,,,,N,N,N,N,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,N,N,N,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,,,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,,,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,,N,,N,219.37,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,,,,,,,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,63.75,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,22.916,100,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,Peak INR: DaY 3,N,N,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,,,Y,,N,N,,Y,,,,,,,,,,N,,N,N,N,N,N,,,,,,N,,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,10827,N,9000,,N,N,,N,N,,,,,,N,N,N,N,N,,N,24.05,150.96,N,N,N,N,,,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,,N,N,,,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,N,Y,N,N,N,Y,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,Y,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,,,,,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,,,,,N,N,N,N,,,N,,,,,,,N,N,,N,,,N,N,N,N,,,,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,,,,,,,,N,N,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,,,N,,N,N,N,,,N,,,,,,,,,,,N,N,,,,,,,,,,Y,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,,,N,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,,,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,,,,,,N,,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,42.0

Three female military personnel fell unconscious almost simultaneously around noon after a long-distance march that had started at 6 AM. The fire department in Gotenba received a 119 call [at 1:16 PM] and requested dispatch of the eastern Shizuoka doctor helicopter (DH) because it would take about 1 hour from the scene to arrive at our hospital by ground ambulance. At that time, the DH of eastern Shizuoka was transporting an injured patient to Kanagawa Prefecture, so the flight dispatcher of the DH of eastern Shizuoka decided to request support DHs from Kanagawa Prefectures based on an agreement concerning collaboration using the DH. The DH of Kanagawa Prefecture met 1 of the patients and transported her to its base hospital.

On presentation, the patient had a temperature of 41.7Â°C (rectal). External cooling was started immediately. The patient was intubated in view of a Glasgow Coma Scale of 7 and was transferred to theintensive therapy unit. Laboratory results revealed an acute kidney injury, rhabdomyolysis, disseminated intravascular coagulopathy and acute liver failure. The patient was encephalopathic, jaundiced and difficult to sedate. His liver function continued to deteriorate with alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels reaching 9207 U/L. King's Hospital Liver Centre, London was contacted for a possible liver transplant, and they advised an infusion of N-acetylcysteine. The following day liver function tests improved; thus, transplantation was not performed. The patient failed multiple sedation holds and required a tracheostomy. He continued to spike a fever. Despite no source of sepsis being found, the patient remained on broad spectrum antibiotics to cover for any potential infective causes until day 27. After 15 days, the patient's encephalopathy gradually improved. He was weaned off the ventilator and underwent intense physiotherapy.

Utilizing an ad libitum approach or limiting fluid availability during field or recreational events of up to 3 h may prevent symptomatic hyponatremia while limiting significant dehydration.",Case series,3,NR,27,M,NR,Y,N,N,N,N,N,N,NR,N,N,Occupational,Outdoor training (NR),,Occupational (Training/Test/Exercise/Course),Military Training (Occupational),NR,NR,NR,28.8889,32,9.14141153856279,,,,,,,,,37.05556,,,,,,,,,Pre-Treatment,N,,,,NR,EHI,Hyponatremia,Recovered,NR,,,,,,,,,,NR,N,,N,N,,N,N,,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,,,,,N,N,N,,N,N,,,N,N,,,,,N,N,,N,N,,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,,,,N,N,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,,,N,,N,,,,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,,N,N,,,N,,,,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,,,,,N,N,N,N,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,N,N,N,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,,,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,,,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,,,,,,,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,,,N,,N,N,,,,,,,,,,,,N,,N,N,N,N,N,,,,,,N,,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,Y,Y,,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,,N,N,,,,,,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,,N,N,,,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,N,N,Y,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,,,,,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,,,,,N,N,N,N,,,N,,,,,,,N,N,,N,,,N,N,N,N,,,,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,,,,,,,,N,N,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,,,N,,N,N,N,,,N,,,,,,,,,,,N,N,,,,,,,,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,Y,N,N,N,N,,,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,,,N,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,125,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,,,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,,,,,,N,,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,37.05556

Mild to moderate hepatic injury is common in exertional heatstroke, while fulminant liver failure is rare. Extrapyramidal symptoms and pulmonary aspergillosis secondary to liver failure induced by exertional heatstroke have never been reported in prior cases. Case presentation: A 25-year-old Han Chinese man presented with exertional heatstroke with fulminant liver failure, subsequent pulmonary aspergillosis, and extrapyramidal symptoms. Moreover, he also presented with coma, rhabdomyolysis, acute kidney injury, and disseminated intravascular coagulation. He recovered under conservative treatment including therapeutic plasma exchange plus continuous veno-venous hemofiltration, fluid resuscitation, antibiotics, and other support therapy. Conclusions: Therapeutic plasma exchange plus continuous veno-venous hemofiltration could be effective for patients with heatstroke who suffer liver failure and other organ failure.

Rhabdomyolysis usually occurs in the acute phase of heat stroke. We herein report a case of heat stroke in a patient who experienced bimodal rhabdomyolysis in the acute and recovery phases. Case presentation: A 34-year-old male patient was found lying unconscious on the road after participating in a half marathon in the spring. It was a sunny day with a maximum temperature of 24.2Â°C. His medical and family history was unremarkable. Upon arrival, his Glasgow Coma Scale score was 10. However, the patient's marked restlessness and confusion returned. A sedative was administered and tracheal intubation was performed. On the second day of hospitalization, a blood analysis was compatible with a diagnosis of acute hepatic failure; thus, he received fresh frozen plasma and a platelet transfusion was performed, following plasma exchange and continuous hemodiafiltration. The patient's creatinine phosphokinesis (CPK) level increased to 8832IU/L on the fifth day of hospitalization and then showed a tendency to transiently decrease. The patient was extubated on the eighth day of hospitalization after the improvement of his laboratory data. From the ninth day of hospitalization, gradual rehabilitation was initiated. However, he felt pain in both legs and his CPK level increased again. Despite the cessation of all drugs and rehabilitation, his CPK level increased to 105,945IU/L on the 15th day of hospitalization. Fortunately, his CPK level decreased with a fluid infusion. The patient's rehabilitation was restarted after his CPK level fell to <10,000IU/L. On the 31st day of hospitalization, his CK level decreased to 623IU/L and he was discharged on foot. Later, a genetic analysis revealed that he had a thermolabile genetic phenotype of carnitine palmitoyltransferase II (CPT II). Conclusions: Physicians should pay special attention to the stress of rehabilitation exercises, which may cause collapsed muscles that are injured by severe heat stroke to repeatedly flare up.",Case report,1,NR,34,M,NR,Y,N,CPT II Deficiency,N,N,N,N,NR,Y,N,Athletic,Half marathon (completed),Run,Athletic (Physical Activity/Training/Exercise),Competitive Physical Activity (Athletic/Recreational),21.1,NR,Spring 2016,24.2,54,11.882118753562885,,,,,,,,,,40.8,,,,,,,,Pre-Treatment,Y,40.2,Bladder temperature,Hospital admission,NR,EHS,Rhabdomyolysis,Recovered,NR,,,,,,,,,,NR,N,,N,Y,,N,N,,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,Y,,Y,,,N,N,N,,N,N,,,N,N,,,,,N,N,,N,N,,301,105945,,N,N,N,N,N,Peak CPK: DaY 15,Y,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,,,,N,N,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,,,N,,N,,,,,,N,Y,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,,N,N,,,N,,,,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,,,,,N,N,N,N,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Y,N,N,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,Y,Y,Y,N,N,N,N,Y,,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,140,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,301,N,,,,,110,80,,N,N,7.374,95,N,23.7,152,N,N,N,N,13.5,63.43,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,8.6,N,,N,,N,50,N,N,48.3,N,N,,101,N,N,N,,,,,,,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,22,N,N,N,22.1,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,9.3,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,Y,N,,,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,,,Y,,N,N,,Y,Y,,,,,,,,,N,,N,N,N,N,N,,,,,,N,,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,N,,,3,N,46,14894,35,14355,,N,N,,N,N,,,,,,N,N,N,285,N,,N,10.26,N,N,N,N,N,,,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,,Y,N,,,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,N,N,40,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,N,Y,Y,N,N,Y,N,N,Y,N,N,Y,N,N,N,N,N,Y,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,,,,,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,,,,,N,N,N,N,,,N,,,,,,,N,N,,N,,,N,N,N,N,,,,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,,,,,,,,N,N,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,N,N,6,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,,,N,,Y,N,N,,,N,,,,,,,,,,,N,N,,,,,,,,,,Y,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,Y,N,Y,N,,,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,,,N,N,N,N,,,210.39,N,N,N,N,27.3,N,N,N,N,N,146,4.3,113,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,,,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,,,,,,N,,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,40.8

The former two are common presentations in the emergency department (ED). On the other hand, malignant hyperthermia (MH) is an uncommon but equally dangerous condition that requires prompt recognition and specific treatment with dantrolene sodium and avoidance of certain medications to reduce morbidity and mortality. Recent research focusing on nonanesthetic or exercise-induced MH has demonstrated a relationship between certain gene mutations and malignant hyperthermia susceptibility.

The former two are common presentations in the emergency department (ED). On the other hand, malignant hyperthermia (MH) is an uncommon but equally dangerous condition that requires prompt recognition and specific treatment with dantrolene sodium and avoidance of certain medications to reduce morbidity and mortality. Recent research focusing on nonanesthetic or exercise-induced MH has demonstrated a relationship between certain gene mutations and malignant hyperthermia susceptibility.

Because of its common occurrence, many military trainees practice preventive measures prior to any activity requiring severe exertion. Although it is said to be common in practice, different presentations of heat stroke are scarcely described in literature. Case Presentation: We describe a case of an exertional heat stroke in a 23-year-old male Sinhalese soldier who developed early changes of renal failure, liver failure and rhabdomyolysis. The patient initially presented with convulsions, delirium and loss of consciousness to an outside health care facility before being transferred to our institution. Conclusion: It is clear that heat stroke does occur in military trainees while preventive strategies are being practiced. It is important for those who provide healthcare to soldiers to provide proper advice on how to identify impending heat stroke prior to any exercises resulting in severe physical exertion. Further, treating physicians should educate all military trainees about preventive strategies.",Case report,1,NR,23,M,NR,N,Diagnosed with Asymptomatic non-febrile bacterial infection during hospital admission,N,N,N,N,N,NR,N,N,Occupational,Ruck march 14.5km (4h),March,Occupational (Training/Test/Exercise/Course),Military Training (Occupational),0,4h,2015-05-01 00:00:00,30,76,23.0648956238145,,17,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,39,Hospital/Clinic Admission,N,,,,40,EHS,"Acute kidney injury, liver failure, and probable rhabdomyolysis",Recovered,NR,,,,,,,,,,NR,N,,Y,Y,,N,N,,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,Y,,Y,,,N,N,N,,N,N,,,N,N,,,,,N,N,,N,N,,17700,N,,N,N,N,N,N,INitial CPK: DaY 3,Y,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,,,,N,N,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,,,N,,N,,,,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,,N,N,,Y,N,,,,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,,,,,N,N,N,N,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,N,N,N,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,N,N,Y,N,N,Y,N,N,,N,N,N,N,Y,,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,119,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,,,115,57,,N,N,7.34,N,N,27,N,N,N,N,N,14.6,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,10.2,N,,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,66,N,N,N,,,,,,,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,,,Y,,N,N,,Y,,,,,,,,,,N,,N,N,N,N,N,,,,,,N,,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,N,,,N,N,104,601,114,408,,N,N,,N,N,,,,,,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,,N,N,,,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,N,Y,Y,N,N,Y,N,N,Y,N,N,Y,N,N,N,N,N,Y,Y,N,Y,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,,,,,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,,,,,N,N,N,N,,,N,,,,,,,N,N,,N,,,N,N,N,N,,,,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,,,,,,,,N,N,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,N,N,9,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,,,N,,Y,N,N,,,N,,,,,,,,,,,N,N,,,,,,,,,,Y,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,,,N,N,N,N,,,176.8,N,46,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,,,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,,,,,,N,,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,39.0

DOI: 10.1136/bcr-2015-212592",26851253,10.1136/bcr-2015-212592,"This report discusses a unique case of monozygotic male twins who both collapsed with exertional heat stroke (EHS) during the same marathon in relatively cool conditions. The twins were official race pacers in a popular city marathon held in the early spring in the UK.

Given the severe morbidity that can accompany the disease, the immediate management often begins in the prehospital setting. It is important to have not only a comprehensive understanding of the prehospital cooling methods in addition to hospital management strategies, but an understanding of their potential complications as well. Case Report A 32-year-old male presented to a San Antonio hospital in March 2014 with progressive confusion, nausea, nonbloody emesis, and ataxia. Initial presentation was concerning for exertional heat stroke, as the patient was recorded in the field to have a temperature of 42.1Â°C (106.2Â°F). The patient, on arrival to the emergency department, was found to have a core body temperature of 38.1Â°C (100.6Â°F). All active cooling measures were terminated and active rewarming was initiated. Despite adequate resuscitation and rapid identification of the patient's overcorrection in core body temperature, the lowest recorded temperature was 36.0Â°C (96.8Â°F). Why Should an Emergency Physician Be Aware of This ? This case represents the dangers associated with exertional heat stroke, overcorrection of core body temperature, and the potentially lethal complication of afterdrop. It also represents the need for immediate recognition of the condition and initiation of appropriate medical care.

It has repeatedly been shown that EHS can occur in well-trained patients with known MH-associated mutation in the RYR1 gene in the absence of any extreme environmental conditions or extreme physical activity, thereby supporting a possible link between EHS and MH. In this case, a highly trained 30-year-old male athlete suddenly collapsed while running. He had initial hyperthermia (40.2Â°C) and progressive multiple organ failure requiring medical management in an intensive care unit. After he recovered completely, a maximal exercise test was performed and showed an obvious abnormality of oxidative metabolism in muscle; genetic analysis of the RYR1 gene identified a heterozygous missense variation p.K1393R.

It has repeatedly been shown that EHS can occur in well-trained patients with known MH-associated mutation in the RYR1 gene in the absence of any extreme environmental conditions or extreme physical activity, thereby supporting a possible link between EHS and MH. In this case, a highly trained 30-year-old male athlete suddenly collapsed while running. He had initial hyperthermia (40.2Â°C) and progressive multiple organ failure requiring medical management in an intensive care unit. After he recovered completely, a maximal exercise test was performed and showed an obvious abnormality of oxidative metabolism in muscle; genetic analysis of the RYR1 gene identified a heterozygous missense variation p.K1393R. Consequently, the athlete was given appropriate information and allowed to progressively return to sport competition.DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS: Doping, use of drugs and toxic agents, exercise-associated hyponatremia, exertional heat illness.TREATMENT: Initial management started with the basic resuscitative guidelines of airway, breathing, and circulation (intubation).

Diagnosis of ALF in the context of HS is confounded by numerous laboratory abnormalities related to multisystem organ dysfunction. Case Report We present the case of a 20-year-old male athlete with exertional HS who developed ALF and was treated successfully with orthotopic liver transplantation. He remained well after 1 year with normal liver function and no permanent neurologic impairment. Diagnosis and treatment was guided by serial monitoring of coagulation factors and intracranial pressure (ICP). Conclusions Currently, there are no well validated prognostic tools that predict the need for or survival with orthotopic liver transplantation for HS. We propose that serial monitoring of coagulation factors and, when safe and feasible, ICP monitoring may help to guide clinical decision making in this context.",Case report,1,NR,20,M,NR,Y,N,N,N,N,N,N,NR,N,N,Athletic,Football training (NR),Football,Athletic (Physical Activity/Training/Exercise),Sport/Training (Athletic),NR,NR,2014-07-01 00:00:00,43.3333,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,40,Pre-Treatment,N,,,,40,EHS,Acute liver failure,Recovered,NR,,,,,,,,,,NR,N,,N,N,,N,N,,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,Y,,Y,,,N,N,N,,N,N,,,N,N,,,,,N,N,,N,N,,8000,72000,,N,17,N,N,N,"Peak CK: DaY 3

We report an unusual case of acute vertebrobasilar territory infarcts due to heat stroke. A middle-aged man developed hyperpyrexia (42.2Â°C) after strenuous fieldwork in a hot summer day. Next morning, he was found in altered sensorium. The brain imaging showed acute posteromedial midbrain and cerebellar infarcts. A diagnosis of acute ischemic stroke due to heat stroke was made, and the patient was put under the intensive care unit. Two weeks later, the patient became conscious, but had slurred speech and incoordination in all the 4 limbs. Six months after rehabilitation, the patient still have scanning speech and limb ataxia. Acute ischemic stroke worsened the prognosis in our patient. Acute infarct is a very rare neurologic manifestation of heat stroke.

DOI: 10.1080/00913847.2015.1001714",25586818,10.1080/00913847.2015.1001714,"Athletes are often advised to drink in order to â€œfully replace bodyweight lossesâ€ in order to prevent exertional heatstroke (EHS) during exercise in the heat. There is little evidence that â€œdehydrationâ€ in the range experienced by athletes adversely affects thermoregulation or is the exclusive cause of EHS. In contrast it is established that excess fluid intake can cause exerciseassociated hyponatremia (EAH) sometimes associated with encephalopathy (EAHE). As part of a series of experiments to determine optimal fluid replacement during exercise in the heat, we studied a group of exceptionally well-conditioned and heat-adapted members of the South African National Defence Force. A 20 year old male started a time restricted 50 km route-march in a dry bulb temperature that reached 37.5Â°C (WBGT of 33.6Â°C, relative humidity of 85%). Pre-march plasma osmolality, serum [Na+] and total body water measures indicated euhydration. Fluid was available ad libitum and isotonic sports drinks at 5 km intervals. Fluid intake and core body temperature (Tc) were recorded throughout while he was tracked by a global positioning system measuring distance travelled, position and speed. Comparing the total fluid intake of the soldier (12930 mL) to the rest of the participants (mean intake of 9 038 mL) up to 40 km, it is evident that his intake was 3892 mL (approximately 300 mL h-1) more than the mean for group. At approximately 17h14 the soldier was found lying by himself at the side of the route, 2.24 km from the finish point. He passed away the next day in a medical care facility. This tragic event provides the valuable opportunity to present data on the pacing, temperature regulation and fluid consumption of an exceptional athlete during the development of a fatal case of combined EAHE and EHS. Pacing, fluid intake, Tc and environmental condition data are presented for 5km intervals throughout the march. We propose a novel hypothesis on the possible contribution of EAHE to the development of EHS.",Case report,1,NR,20,M,25.49,Y,N,N,N,N,N,N,Overweight,N,N,Occupational,Time restricted march 50km (47.8km),March,Occupational (Training/Test/Exercise/Course),Military Training (Occupational),47.76,NR,NR,30.9,47.4,15.102113378450072,26.9,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,42.6,,Pre-Treatment,Y,42.3,Rectal,Medical tent,42,EHS,Hyponatremia,Passed away,NR,,,,,,,,,,NR,N,,N,N,,N,N,,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,Y,,N,Y,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,,,,,N,N,N,,N,N,,,N,N,,,,,N,N,,N,N,,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,,Y,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,,,,N,N,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,,,N,,N,,,,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,,Y,Y,,,N,,,,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,,,,,N,N,N,N,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,N,N,N,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,,,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,120,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,,,90,60,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,,,,,,,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,,,N,,N,N,,,,,,,,,,,,N,,N,N,N,N,N,,,,,,N,,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,Y,,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,,N,N,,,,,,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,Y,N,,,,Y,N,,,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,N,N,26,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,Y,N,,N,N,N,N,,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,N,Y,Y,N,N,Y,N,N,Y,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,Y,N,Y,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,,,,,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,,,,,N,N,N,N,,,N,,,,,,,Y,N,,N,,,N,N,N,N,,,,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,,,,,,,,N,N,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,,,N,,N,N,N,,,N,,,,,,,,,,,N,N,,,,,,,,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,Y,N,N,N,N,,,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,,,N,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,120,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,"Serum Na+ measured oN ED admissioN, post treatmeNt iN medical teNt.",N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,,,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,,,,,,N,,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,42.6

DOI: NIL",25011205,NIL,"Exertional heat stroke can occur even after moderate efforts in persons predisposed to the condition. Consequences can be far-reaching, potentially leading to multi-organ failure and possibly death. We discuss the case of a 23-year old army recruit presenting with altered consciousness and hyperthermia after a training march. Following initial clinical improvement, rising CK and liver enzyme levels as well as increasing INR were recorded. Facing the risk of multi-organ failure, the patient was transferred to a specialized ICU. The condition could be stabilized without recurring to molecular adsorbent recirculation system (MARS). Exertional heat stroke must be readily recognized as such for correct treatment to be initiated.

In this setting, fulminant hepatic failure (FHF) occurs as a result of severe hypoxic hepatitis.Case Report We report the case of a young male athlete who developed exertional heatstroke associated with rhabdomyolysis and hypoxic hepatitis while running the final stages of an ultra-marathon (62 km). The patient rapidly developed multiorgan failure, including fulminant hepatic failure, requiring intensive care admission for mechanical ventilation, hemodialysis, and inotropic support. He failed to improve with supportive measures and underwent an emergency hepatectomy followed by orthotopic liver transplant, after which he recovered completely.Conclusions We discuss the rationale for liver transplantation in this setting, possible alternative treatments, and the pathophysiology of fulminant liver failure in this rare case.",Case report,1,NR,40,M,NR,Y,N,N,N,N,N,N,NR,Y,N,Athletic,Marathon 62km (57km),Run,Athletic (Physical Activity/Training/Exercise),Competitive Physical Activity (Athletic/Recreational),57,NR,NR,29,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,NR,N,,,,NR,EHS,Fulminant hepatic failure,Recovered,NR,,,,,,,,,,NR,N,,N,N,,N,N,,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,Y,,Y,,,N,N,N,,N,N,,,N,N,,,,,N,N,,N,N,,25640,N,,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,,,,N,N,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,,,N,,N,,,,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,,N,N,,,N,,,,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,Y,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,Y,,,,N,N,N,N,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,N,N,N,,,,,,,,,,,,,Y,,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,,,,,Y,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,,,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,,,,,,,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,59.77,106.42,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,3.6,24,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,"Peak INR, APTT: DaY 2",N,N,N,N,N,,,Y,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,,,Y,,N,N,,Y,,,,,,,,,,N,,N,N,N,N,N,,,,,,N,,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,N,,,N,N,2884,4900,3600,6384,,N,N,,N,N,,,,,,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,,N,N,,,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,Y,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,N,Y,N,N,N,Y,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,Y,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,Y,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,,,,,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,,,,,N,N,N,N,,,N,,,,,,,N,N,,N,,,N,N,N,N,,,,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,,,,,,,,N,N,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,N,N,3,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,,,N,,Y,N,N,,,N,,,,,,,,,,,N,N,,,,,,,,,,Y,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,,,N,Y,N,N,,,594000,N,N,22,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,,,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,,,,,,N,,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,

The notion that significantly altered mental status must accompany elevated core temperature in heat illness may delay recognition and treatment. We report on a series of marathon and half-marathon runners who suffered exertional heat illness during a marathon race in relatively mild conditions. Altered mental status was not uniformly present. All patients were treated in the finish line medical tent and responded well to cooling. More than half were discharged from the medical tent without being transported to the hospital. This case series demonstrates that many runners respond to early identification and treatment of exertional heat illness.

DOI: 10.1186/1752-1947-7-62",23497698,10.1186/1752-1947-7-62,"Introduction. Little information is available on the pathogenesis of heatstroke without strenuous exercise in younger patients. Here, we report the case of a 31-year-old man who developed heatstroke secondary to hyponatremia. His condition was initially misdiagnosed as classic heatstroke. We hope the detailed description of our patient's case will provide valuable information for medical professionals faced with similar cases in the future. Case presentation. A 31-year-old Japanese man who was regularly taking anti-hypertensive agents, including a thiazide, was admitted to our hospital owing to consciousness disturbance and a high-grade fever. A thorough examination revealed mild renal dysfunction, rhabdomyolysis, a hyper-coagulable state, and severe hyponatremia (114mEq/L). Because he worked in a hot environment, an initial diagnosis of heatstroke was established. His general condition improved rapidly with supportive measures, and he was discharged on the fourth day after admission. Interestingly, he did not recognize feeling hot while working in a hot environment. These findings suggest that the consciousness disturbance, which was probably attributable to acute hyponatremia caused by the thiazide, preceded the onset of the heatstroke. Conclusions: Clinicians should consider the presence of underlying diseases, especially consciousness disturbance, when younger individuals develop heatstroke in the absence of strenuous exercise.

DOI: 10.1016/j.annemergmed.2011.11.005",22153997,10.1016/j.annemergmed.2011.11.005,"Heat stroke is defined by central nervous system abnormalities and failure of proper maintenance of thermoregulation as a result of high core body temperature ensuing from exposure to high environmental temperatures or strenuous exercise. Common complications include acute respiratory distress syndrome, disseminated intravascular coagulation, acute renal injury, hepatic injury, and rhabdomyolysis. Myocardial injury may also occur during heat stroke, resulting in cardiac enzyme increase and ST-segment changes on the ECG. Such findings might behave as diagnostic pitfalls by mimicking the presentation of coronary artery occlusive myocardial infarction. A previous case report described a patient with heat stroke and ST-segment elevation, in which the definite cause of the ST-segment elevation was unclear; however, acute myocardial infarction caused by coronary artery disease was ruled out according to the clinical signs, serial ECG changes, and serum level of cardiac biomarkers. Stress-induced cardiomyopathy (Takotsubo cardiomyopathy) was suspected, but it could not be confirmed because of the lack of coronary angiography. We herein report a case of heat stroke presenting with ST-segment elevation and cardiogenic shock. Coronary angiography was performed and coronary artery occlusive myocardial infarction was ruled out because of the presence of patent coronary arteries. Left ventriculography showed midventricular and apical hypokinesis, and stress-induced cardiomyopathy was then determined to be the appropriate diagnosis. Heat stroke causes increase of serum catecholamine levels, in which oversecretion and abnormal responses to catecholamines are a possible cause of stress-induced cardiomyopathy. Catecholamines may therefore be the key in linking heat stroke and stress-induced cardiomyopathy.

Common complications include acute respiratory distress syndrome, disseminated intravascular coagulation, acute renal injury, hepatic injury, and rhabdomyolysis. Myocardial injury may also occur during heat stroke, resulting in cardiac enzyme increase and ST-segment changes on the ECG. Such findings might behave as diagnostic pitfalls by mimicking the presentation of coronary artery occlusive myocardial infarction. A previous case report described a patient with heat stroke and ST-segment elevation, in which the definite cause of the ST-segment elevation was unclear; however, acute myocardial infarction caused by coronary artery disease was ruled out according to the clinical signs, serial ECG changes, and serum level of cardiac biomarkers. Stress-induced cardiomyopathy (Takotsubo cardiomyopathy) was suspected, but it could not be confirmed because of the lack of coronary angiography. We herein report a case of heat stroke presenting with ST-segment elevation and cardiogenic shock. Coronary angiography was performed and coronary artery occlusive myocardial infarction was ruled out because of the presence of patent coronary arteries. Left ventriculography showed midventricular and apical hypokinesis, and stress-induced cardiomyopathy was then determined to be the appropriate diagnosis. Heat stroke causes increase of serum catecholamine levels, in which oversecretion and abnormal responses to catecholamines are a possible cause of stress-induced cardiomyopathy. Catecholamines may therefore be the key in linking heat stroke and stress-induced cardiomyopathy.

DOI: 10.1186/1865-1380-4-12",21509146,10.1186/1865-1380-4-12,"Exertional heat illness typically occurs over hours in younger athletic patients or military recruits who exercise at elevated temperatures for a sufficient period of time to cause the rate of heat production to exceed the capacity of the body to dissipate heat. Since the physiological response to exercise includes cutaneous vasodilation and sweating, any limitation of such a response can cause rapid hyperthermia and thus heat stroke. One such condition is extensive burns healed by cicatrisation of the skin where the scar and grafted skin surface do not have functional sweat glands and are unable to lose heat in response to high temperatures. The authors report one unique case of a female marathon runner with exertional heat stroke who had recovered from deep second and third degree burns over approximately 50% of her body a few years ago.

Early diagnosis and treatment are therefore crucial determinants of the patient's prognosis. The following case report depicts a soldier who presented primarily with confusion and behavioral changes during physical exercise and later lost consciousness. He was misdiagnosed by the field physician as suffering from supraventricular tachycardia, was treated as such and only diagnosed as suffering from EHS later in the emergency room. Our main aims are: to highlight the possibility of misdiagnosis of EHS even among trained physicians, to describe the main symptoms of EHS, and to emphasize the importance of early diagnosis and proper treatment.",Case report,1,NR,19,M,NR,Y,N,N,N,N,N,N,NR,N,N,Occupational,March 3km (2km),March,Occupational (Training/Test/Exercise/Course),Military Training (Occupational),2,3h,NR,35,50,19.79996998930067,,,,,,,41,,,,,,,,,,,Hospital/Clinic Admission,N,,,,NR,EHS,Multiorgan dysfunction,Recovered,NR,,,,,,,,,,NR,N,,N,N,,N,N,,N,N,N,,,N,Y,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,,Y,,,N,N,N,,N,N,,,N,N,,,,,N,N,,N,N,,563,1800,,N,N,N,N,N,Peak CPK: DaY 2,Y,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,,,,N,N,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,,,N,,N,,,,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,,Y,Y,,Y,N,,,,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,,,,,N,N,N,N,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,N,N,N,,,,,,,,,,,,,Y,,Y,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,,,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,195,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,,,80,40,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,,,,,,,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,1.35,1.98,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,Peak INR: DaY Not reported,N,N,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,,,Y,,N,N,,Y,,,,,,,,,,N,,N,N,N,N,N,,,,,,N,,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,N,,,N,N,55,591,57,584,,N,N,,N,N,,,,,,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,,N,N,,,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,N,N,Y,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,Y,Y,N,N,N,N,N,Y,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,,,,,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,,,,,N,N,N,N,,,N,,,,,,,Y,N,,N,,,N,N,N,N,,,,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,,,,,,,,N,N,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,,,N,,Y,N,N,,,N,,,,,,,,,,,N,N,,,,,,,,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,Y,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,,,N,N,N,Y,,,166.19,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,0.2,N,N,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,,,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,,,,,,N,,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,41.0

The participant (24 years old, 173 cm, 70 kg, and 3 years firefighting experience) experienced heat exhaustion following 7 hours of high ambient temperatures and arduous work on the fire line during the month of August. At the time of the heat-related incident (HRI), core temperature was 40.1 Â°C (104.2 Â°F) and skin temperature was 34.4 Â°C (93.9 Â°F). His work output averaged 1067 countsÂ·min(-1) (arbitrary units for measuring activity) for the 7 hours prior to the HRI, a very high rate of work over an extended time period during wildfire suppression. In the 2.5 hours leading up to the heat incident, he was exposed to a mean ambient temperature of 44.6 Â°C (112.3 Â°F), with a maximum temperature of 59.7 Â°C (139.5 Â°F). He consumed an average of 840 mLÂ·h(-1) in the 7 hours leading up to the incident and took an average of 24 Â± 11 drinksÂ·h(-1) (total of 170 drinks). The combined effects of a high work rate and high ambient temperatures resulted in an elevated core temperature and a higher volume and frequency of drinking than typically seen in this population, ultimately ending in heat exhaustion and removal from the fire line. The data demonstrate that heat-related incidents can occur even with aggressive fluid intake during wildland fire suppression. Copyright Â© 2011 Wilderness Medical Society. Published by Elsevier Inc.

DOI: 10.1123/jsr.20.2.219",21576713,10.1123/jsr.20.2.219,"Introduction: Exertional heat stroke (EHS) is a major concern in military trainees performing intense physical exercise, with substantial morbidity rates. Prehospital diagnosis of EHS is essentially clinical. Thus, soldiers, command personnel, and medical staff are taught to recognize this injury and immediately begin aggressive treatment to prevent further deterioration. Patients and Methods: During 2007, 5 otherwise healthy Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) soldiers were diagnosed with EHS while performing strenuous exercise. They were treated vigorously according to the IDF EHS-treatment protocol and were referred to the emergency department. Results: On arrival at the emergency department, physical examination including rectal temperature was unremarkable in all soldiers. Blood and urine workup showed near-normal values. No other medical conditions that could have explained the clinical presentation were found. All soldiers were discharged shortly afterward, with no further consequences. A heat-tolerance test was performed several weeks after the event and was interpreted as normal. All soldiers returned to active service. Conclusion: Because the initial clinical findings were very suggestive of EHS and because no other condition could have explained the prehospital transient hyperthermia, we suggest that these soldiers were correctly diagnosed with EHS, and we propose that rapid vigorous cooling prevented further deterioration and complications. We suggest calling this condition aborted heat stroke.

DOI: 10.4323/rjlm.2010.239",NIL,10.4323/rjlm.2010.239,"Hyperthermia, characterized by a core temperature of over 40Â°C, occurs when the body's thermoregulatory mechanisms are no longer able to dissipate heat. From a clinical point of view hyperthermia can be of three main types: (1) a consequence of an imbalance between anti and pro-inflammatory agents (usually in septic conditions), (2) heatstroke and (3) malignant hyperthermia. Death caused by hyperthermia, either heatstroke or malignant hyperthermia, is diagnosed at the autopsy mainly using seric, histopathological and imunohistochemical methods. Even though unspectific morphological lesions are found in almost every organ, the most affected are skeletal muscles, gut, kidneys and brain. We present here a case of severe hyperthermia leading to heatstroke and discuss the main diagnostic methods available to the forensic pathologist.

Despite aggressive body cooling, massive intravenous transfusion, and supply of inotropic agents, shock was persistent. To evaluate adrenal function, an adrenocorticotropic hormone stimulation test was conducted and the results indicated that he had critical illness-related corticosteroid insufficiency (CIRCI) as a result of adrenal insufficiency. Continuous hydorocortisone administration was started and he recovered from shock within a few hours. He was discharged on the thirty-seventh hospital day. Serum cortisol and cytokine concentrations were initially high and the cytokines decreased subsequent to hydrocortisone administration. It is speculated that CIRCI is an exacerbating factor in heat stroke, and hydrocortisone may be a potential therapeutic approach in such patients.

DOI: NIL",NIL,NIL,"There are a few cases reported of cerebellar involvement following heat stroke worldwide. We present a rare case of cerebellar atrophy following heat stroke in India. A 25-year-old male soldier in the Indian army presented with giddiness followed by loss of consciousness after extreme exertion during a prolonged march past in hot and humid climate. Clinical examination revealed tachycardia and hyperpyrexia (106Â°F). All preliminary investigations were normal. With a diagnosis of heat stroke, rapid cooling was applied with external cooling chamber and intravenous fluids were given to rehydrate the patient. Antipyretics were given per rectally to bring down the temperature. 7 days later, the patient regained consciousness but developed incoordination of movement of all four limbs and slurring of speech.

A 49-year-old male laborer, suffering from heat stroke syndromes (e.g., hyperpyrexia, seizure and coma, and hypotension), was admitted to an emergency unit of a medical center hospital. The patient displayed multiple organ dysfunction with rhabdomyolysis, hepatic, renal, respiratory, and cerebral dysfunction, and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Both hyperpyrexia and multiple organ dysfunction were resistant to conventional treatment measures. HBOT was adopted to rescue the patient from heat stroke-induced death. Before HBOT, analyses of serum revealed hypercoagulable state or DIC as well as signs of rhabdomyolysis, and renal and hepatic failure. In addition, pulmonary edema, coma, hypotension, and hyperpyrexia occurred. HBOT was used successfully to combat these syndromes and to rescue the patient from heat stroke death. This case suggests that HBOT is useful for treatment of heat stroke with multiple organ dysfunction.

All five deaths were reported to be the consequence of exertional heatstroke. One runner of 6874 participating in an annual 56-km ultramarathon developed heatstroke and required active cooling for 10 h to achieve normothermia. The purpose of this article was to postulate (i) why only 6 of 35,627 athletes were hospitalized for heatstroke in these races, (ii) if exercise alone could have elevated their body temperatures sufficiently to cause heatstroke, and (iii) why the runner required such prolonged cooling. Methods: Clinical and autopsy data are presented for three of the cyclists and the runner for whom access to this information was granted. Calculations were made to predict the work rates necessary to produce their measured rectal temperatures. Results: The rectal temperatures of two of the cyclists were 42.0 and 41.2Â°C on hospitalization, and that of the runner was 41.8Â°C on collapse. Standard calculations showed that in the prevailing environmental conditions and with their exercise speeds, none should have developed exertional heatstroke. The third cyclist experienced a cardiac arrest to which his elevated (rectal) temperature may have contributed. Conclusion: The hyperthermic states experienced by the cases presented may have resulted from failure of their heat-losing mechanisms. Alternatively, they might have resulted from excessive endothermy, triggered by physical exertion and other unknown initiating factors. Excessive endothermy should be considered in cases of heatstroke that occur in mild to moderate environmental conditions. Furthermore, prompt initiation of cooling is crucial in all cases of suspected heatstroke.

All five deaths were reported to be the consequence of exertional heatstroke. One runner of 6874 participating in an annual 56-km ultramarathon developed heatstroke and required active cooling for 10 h to achieve normothermia. The purpose of this article was to postulate (i) why only 6 of 35,627 athletes were hospitalized for heatstroke in these races, (ii) if exercise alone could have elevated their body temperatures sufficiently to cause heatstroke, and (iii) why the runner required such prolonged cooling. Methods: Clinical and autopsy data are presented for three of the cyclists and the runner for whom access to this information was granted. Calculations were made to predict the work rates necessary to produce their measured rectal temperatures. Results: The rectal temperatures of two of the cyclists were 42.0 and 41.2Â°C on hospitalization, and that of the runner was 41.8Â°C on collapse. Standard calculations showed that in the prevailing environmental conditions and with their exercise speeds, none should have developed exertional heatstroke. The third cyclist experienced a cardiac arrest to which his elevated (rectal) temperature may have contributed. Conclusion: The hyperthermic states experienced by the cases presented may have resulted from failure of their heat-losing mechanisms. Alternatively, they might have resulted from excessive endothermy, triggered by physical exertion and other unknown initiating factors. Excessive endothermy should be considered in cases of heatstroke that occur in mild to moderate environmental conditions.

Once faced with a case of heat related illness, severe or mild, the health care professional is often faced with the question of when to reactivate the athlete for competitive sport. Resuming activity without modifying risk factors could lead to recurrence of heat related illness of similar or greater severity. Also, having had heat illness in and of itself may be a risk factor for future heat related illness. The decision to return the athlete and the process of risk reduction is complex and requires input from all of the components of the team. Involving the entire sports medicine team often allows for the safest, most successful return to play strategy. Care must be taken once the athlete does begin to return to activity to allow for re-acclimatization to exercise in the heat prior to resumption particularly following a long convalescent period after more severe heat related illness.

The risk of death is related directly to the peak temperature, duration of exposure and acclimatisation period. This case report illustrates the management of multiple casualties of heat stroke in the emergency department and their outcomes. Clinical feature: Nine policemen arrived in the emergency department in semiconscious state after being retrieved from a group of policemen who were loaded into a bus without proper ventilation during a selection program. All of them presented with hyperpyrexia, hypotension, tachycardia and altered sensorium. Treatment: Immediate evaporative cooling with support of organ-system dysfunction was commenced.

METHODS: A 38-year-old male suffering from severe heat stroke with predominant signs and symptoms of encephalopathy requiring acute admission to an intensive care unit, was admitted to a ten-bed neurological intensive care unit of a tertiary care hospital. The patient developed consecutive multiple organ dysfunction with rhabdomyolysis, and hepatic and respiratory failure. Temperature elevation was resistant to conventional treatment measures. Aggressive intensive care treatment included forced diuresis and endovascular cooling to combat hyperthermia and maintain normothermia. RESULTS: Analyses of serum revealed elevation of proinflammatory cytokines (TNF alpha, IL-6), cytokines (IL-2R), anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-4) and chemokines (IL-8) as well as signs of rhabdomyolysis and hepatic failure.

A 23-year-old comatose male with heat stroke was presented in the emergency room. The condition of the patient was complicated by hepatic failure, rhabdomyolysis, acute renal failure, and cardiac abnormalities. ECG revealed diffuse ST-T elevation; serum levels of myocardial markers were remarkably high and diffuse hypokinesis was observed on the echocardiogram. Cooling procedures, including applying cold vapor to the patient's skin, a gastric lavage with cold water, and an intravenous cold fluid infusion were not successful. Since multiple organ damage (heart, liver, central nervous system, and kidney) was evident, we utilized continuous hemodialysis and hemofiltration, using cold dialysate for efficient cooling. The patient recovered from the multiple organ damage and was removed from the intensive care unit 14 days after the onset. The cardiac abnormalities had normalized within several days without any damage to the myocardium. Q waves were not detected in any lead in the ECG. When interpreting ST-T elevation in the ECG of a heat stroke patient, caution should be used so as to not misdiagnose it as an acute myocardial infarction.

Subsequent disseminated fungal infection in a heatstroke patient has been also described. Beta-d-glucan, a constituent of the fungal cell wall, is an early diagnostic measure for fungal infection. In a heatstroke case, we examined for the first time levels of serum beta-d-glucan and endotoxin. A 34-year-old man with a body temperature of 43.5Â°C was admitted in a state of shock. Prior to the development of disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (DIC), a remarkable elevation of serum beta-d-glucan level to 116 pg/mL (normal level < 6.0 pg/mL) was revealed on the first day of admission. However, serum endotoxin was not detected when using a method that excluded beta-d-glucan contamination from endotoxin measurement (normal level < 1.0 pg/mL). This change of beta-d-glucan level was accompanied by a depressed neutrophil function, especially in phagocytosis of 34% (normal range 70-90%) but not in bacterocidal function (81% versus a normal range of 70-100%). After intensive care including continuous hemodiafiltration, the patient regained consciousness but remained ataxic due to cerebellar infarction, which might have resulted from DIC, and subsequent bilateral fungal oculitis were revealed 45 days after admission. This case report demonstrates the elevation of serum beta-d-glucan but normal endotoxin levels after heatstroke, which may prompt further study to re-examine the serum levels of endotoxin in such catastrophic insults.

Hepatic involvement is one of the hallmarks of heat stroke, affecting nearly all heat stroke patients. It is usually manifested by increased serum levels of liver enzymes, but acute liver failure has also been reported. Liver transplantation has been proposed as a potential treatment in cases of severe liver failure, but there are no unanimous criteria pointing to the right stage in which to conduct the transplantation. Case presentation: We report a case of an 18-year old patient who suffered heat-induced liver failure. The patient was referred for orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) but spontaneously recovered completely with conservative treatment. Conclusions: This case demonstrates the complexity of the decision for liver transplantation in EHS. The various prognostic criteria of acute hepatic failure and their relevance to EHS are critically reviewed, with an aim to assess their application for such a condition.

We herein report a 24-year-old man presenting with acute hepatic failure and rhabdomyolysis following exertional heatstroke during hard physical work on a construction site. Acute hepatic failure occurred after 2 days and led to massive impairment of coagulation parameters. On day 3 after heatstroke the patient fulfilled standard criteria for emergency liver transplantation (i.e. the 'London criteria' and the 'Clichy criteria') but was not transplanted. Nevertheless liver function improved spontaneously thereafter and the patient recovered completely within 12 days. In contrast, the outcome of emergency liver transplantation was dismal in three cases of exertional heatstroke in the literature. Thus conservative management appears to be justified in heatstroke-associated liver failure even in the presence of accepted criteria for emergency liver transplantation.

Design: Prospective case-control study. Methods: Systemic and renal haemodynamics, circulating vasoactive hormones and urinary vasodilator metabolites were determined in 12 military recruits who developed ExHS with ARF but without other organ failure during a three-year period. The control group consisted of 12 recruits who performed similar exercise under the same conditions without developing ExHS. Results: There were significant elevations in circulating pressor hormones (catecholamines, renin, aldosterone and endothelin-1 (ET-1)) and significant decreases in the vasodilatory hormone prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) in the acute phase of ExHS with ARF when compared to ExC.

Discussion: The changes in the plasma levels of these hormones, together with enhanced NO production, may both contribute to the pathophysiology of ARF in ExHS.",Case Series,12,NR,20,NR,NR,Y,N,N,N,N,N,N,NR,N,N,Occupational,"Heavy physical training [5km run, push-ups, sit-ups] (NR)",Mixed Activities (Push-Ups/Sit-Ups/Run),Occupational (Training/Test/Exercise/Course),Military Training (Occupational),5,NR,Jan 1999 - Dec 2001,,,,27.35,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,40.9,Hospital/Clinic Admission,Y,< 38,Rectal,Post-initial treatment,40,EHS,Acute renal failure,Recovered,NR,,,,,,,,,,NR,N,,N,N,,N,N,,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,,,,,N,N,N,,N,N,,,N,N,,,,,N,N,,N,N,,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,,,,N,N,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,,,N,,N,,,,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,,N,N,,,N,,,,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,,,,,N,N,N,N,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,N,N,N,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,,,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,,,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,,,,,,,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,,,N,,N,N,,,,,,,,,,,,N,,N,N,N,N,N,,,,,,N,,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,,N,N,,,,,,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,,N,N,,,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,Y,N,N,N,Y,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,,,,,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,,,,,N,N,N,N,,,N,,,,,,,N,N,,N,,,N,N,N,N,,,,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,,,,,,,,N,N,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,N,N,13,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,,,N,,Y,N,N,,,N,,,,,,,,,,,N,N,,,,,,,,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,,,N,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,,,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,,,,,,N,,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,40.9

We describe the clinical features and 3-month outcome of a patient with near-fatal heat stroke, admitted to our intensive care unit in July, 2001. After heavily working for hours at a construction site during a heat wave, the 28-year-old male presented with 41.4Â°C body temperature and multiorgan failure, consisting of neurological impairment, rhabdomyolysis, acute renal failure, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). In the first week there was no evidence of infection. Treatment included cooling, aggressive volume resuscitation, administration of antithrombin-III concentrates and steroids. The patient survived and recovered normal neurological, renal, respiratory and haematological function, and no disability persisted. This case illustrates survival and complete recovery after multiorgan failure in heat stroke with vigorous intensive care. Treatment with antithrombin and steroids and may well have contributed to the favourable outcome.

Increased serum levels of liver enzymes is a common finding in this condition, whereas liver failure is a more rare event that carries a poor prognosis. Liver transplantation has been recommended as treatment in cases of severe liver failure, but no long-term survival after this procedure in exertional heat stroke has been described. We report the case of a 31-year-old man who had a heat stroke after running 5 km at 21 Â°C. He developed severe liver damage, with serum alanine aminotransferase (ALAT) activities increasing to 16,410 U/l (reference values, 10-50 U/l) after 48 h, concomitantly with a pronounced coagulation disturbance, with Normotest (NT) decreasing to 12% (international normalized ratio (INR) = 4.2) (reference values, 70%-130% for NT and 0.8-1.2 for INR). A liver biopsy on the 5th day after the incident showed extensive liver cell necrosis.

The heatstroke was complicated by seizures, rhabdomyolysis, pneumonia, renal failure, and disseminated intravascular coagulation. The patient's stool and blood cultures grew Campylobacter jejuni. The patient subsequently developed paranasal and gastrointestinal zygomycosis and required surgical debridement and a prolonged course of amphotericin B. The zygomycete cultured was Rhizopus schipperae. This is only the second isolate of R. schipperae that has been described. R. schipperae is characterized by the production of clusters of up to 10 sporangiophores arising from simple but well-developed rhizoids. These asexual reproductive propagules are produced on Czapek Dox agar but are absent on routine mycology media, where only chlamydospores are observed.

DOI: NIL",10879265,NIL,"Heat stroke, which is also known as ""sun stroke,"" is a medical emergency, and fatalities can occur unless it is diagnosed early and treated efficiently. Heat stroke may manifest quite suddenly, giving little time to differentiate it from extreme physical exhaustion in collapsed subjects. It is also known to lead to serious disseminated intravascular coagulation. Sudden death in a young female is presented who collapsed after trekking in a hilly, jungle area in Malaysia on a warm, humid day. She had joined a weight reduction programme a few weeks earlier. She was found collapsed and in a semiconscious state in the jungle by her groupmates and was taken to hospital. On admission she was unconscious, hyperpyrexic, with rapid, thready pulse and a low blood pressure. Biochemical studies revealed metabolic acidosis, elevated liver and cardiac enzymes and impairment of renal function. Her coagulation profile was found to be impaired and she started bleeding through the mouth and nostrils. She also developed watery diarrhoea and initially a septicaemic condition, including acute enteritis was suspected. Despite active treatment, her condition deteriorated and she died eight hours after admission. Autopsy confirmed a generalised bleeding tendency, with pulmonary, oesophageal and gastrointestinal mucosal haemorrhages. Flame-shaped subendocardial shock haemorrhages were seen in the interventricular septum on the left side of the heart. The findings support a diagnosis of heat stroke.

Reported here is a case of EHS in a nonacclimatized young woman who was undergoing strenuous exercise.

It could damage not only body fluid electrolyte hemoeostasis, but kidney, liver, and hematologic function. The example reported herein was a Thai laborer, previously healthy, 32 years of age. He joined the tricycle race from Chiang Mai to Lumpoon, which is about 30 km. The tournament was held on a late morning of high humidity and a temperature of 35Â°C. After biking 25 km, he began having heavy perspiration and suffered from severe myalgia and high fever. He suddenly lapsed into unconsciousness and fell down. He was admitted to the Lumpoon Hospital because of convulsions, and 2 days afterward, anuria, anemia, thrombocytopenia, coagulopathy, and liver impairment were detected. He was later transferred to the Faculty of Medicine for further intensive treatment. Lab analyses showed marked azotemia (BUN 96 mg%, Cr 10.6 mg%), elevation of muscle enzyme (CPK > 1000 U/L, SGOT > 650 U/L), liver failure (SGPT > 650 U/L, DB/TB = 23.0/30.0 mg%) and disseminated coagulopathy; platelet 17,000/mm3, PT 51.1 sec (control 12.5), and PTT 73.5 sec (control 37.7). He was treated with bicarbonated hemodialysis trice weekly. Blood-exchange transfusion was performed 3 times during the first 2 weeks with 10 units of fresh whole blood in each exchange.

DOI: NIL",1930061,NIL,"Aviators flying extended periods in hot environments are known to be at risk for heat-related illness. The risk when wearing chemical individual protective equipment (IPE) is increased even at relatively warm temperatures and light workloads. In this paper, we report the physiological responses of an aviator who had been flying a UH-1H helicopter up to 6 h/d clothed in full IPE on 6 consecutive days prior to the sudden onset of heat illness. His performance during the study was normal, and no clear physiological derangements were noted prior to his symptoms. The rapid evolution of his symptoms after voicing no complaints provides a graphic illustration of the difficult predictability and initial central nervous system effects of this condition.",Case Report,1,NR,32,M,25.99,Y,N,N,N,N,N,N,Overweight,N,N,Occupational,Simulated helicopter aviation operation in PPE [6d training for 6h/d] (2nd flight on 6d),Simulated Field Exercise/Training (PPE),Occupational (Training/Test/Exercise/Course),Military Training (Occupational),0,6h,1905-06-06 00:00:00,,,,29.125,,,,,,39,,,,,,,,,,,Pre-Treatment,Y,38.3,Rectal,Post-initial treatment,40.6,EHI,Nil,Recovered,NR,,,,,,,,,,NR,N,,N,N,,N,N,,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,N,N,Y,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,,,,,N,N,N,,N,N,,,N,N,,,,,N,N,,N,N,,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,,,,N,N,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,,,N,,N,,,,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,,N,N,,,N,,,,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,,,,,N,N,N,N,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,N,N,N,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,Y,N,,N,N,N,N,,,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,,,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,5.25,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,5.1,N,,N,,N,N,14.1,N,42.6,N,N,,107,N,N,N,,,,,,,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,,,N,,N,N,,,,,,,,,,,,N,,N,N,N,N,N,,,,,,N,,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,,N,N,,,,,,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,,N,N,,,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,N,Y,Y,N,N,Y,N,N,Y,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,Y,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,,,,,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,,,,,N,N,N,N,,,N,,,,,,,Y,N,,N,,,N,N,N,N,,,,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,,,,,,,,N,N,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,,,N,,N,N,N,,,N,,,,,,,,,,,N,N,,,,,,,,,,Y,N,N,N,N,Y,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,Y,N,Y,N,N,,,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,,,N,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,61.32,1.02,28.77,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,N,25.23,11.51,6.77,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,,,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,,,,,,N,,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,39.0

DOI: 10.1093/milmed/155.3.116",2107465,10.1093/milmed/155.3.116,"Heat stroke is a medical emergency characterized by sudden loss of consciousness and by failure of the heat-regulating mechanism, as manifested by high fever (usually above 104Â°F) and cessation of sweating. Fatality rates for patients with heat stroke can vary from 0% to more than 40%. Immediately after heat stroke has occurred or is suspected, aggressive cooling measures should be initiated. This case illustrates a 24-year-old commissioned officer who developed heat stroke while running in PT formation dressed with shorts and a T-shirt. Although this patient was in good shape and the wet bulb was only 74.4Â°F, he developed the classic symptoms of heat stroke, with a core temperature of 105.9Â°F. He further developed hepatic and skeletal muscle enzyme abnormalities (SGOT, 4680; CPK, &27; LDH, 821) with hyposphosphatemia (0.8). This patient had no significant risk factors, and after the appropriate treatment, his enzyme abnormalities returned to normal without sequelae.

DOI: NIL",3355482,NIL,"A 32-year-old male (Mr. A.), monitored during an 8-d heat acclimation (HA) investigation, unexpectedly exhibited heat intolerance and heat exhaustion. Thirteen other males completed HA without indications of either heat intolerance or heat exhaustion. Because Mr. A. responded normally to HA on days 1-4, the intervention of an unknown host factor on days 5-8 was suggested. Mr. A.'s heat exhaustion episode (day 8) was apparently forewarned by loss of body weight and increased Î”HR, Î”Tsk (days 5-8) and Î”Tre (days 7-8) during daily 90-min trials. His symptoms indicated classical salt depletion heat exhaustion, but the calculated salt deficit (<0.1 g NaClÂ·kg-1 body weight) was mild.

Reports of fatal heat stroke appear regularly from other countries, particularly Australasia and North America, and documented cases have occurred in environmental temperatures as low as 10Â°C. We report the first case in Britain and suggest measures for prevention and initial treatment. To prevent heat stroke races should be held at a suitable time and season. Competitors should be trained, acclimatised, and able to recognise early symptoms. They should know the risk factors and should not run if unwell. Adequate hydration before, during, and after the race is essential, as this case report shows. Spotters should be deployed along the route to identify exhausted runners and emergency facilities provided to cool patients. Rapid reduction of core temperature and maintenance of cardiac output are essential in the immediate management of heat exhaustion. As any delay may lead to fatal complications treatment should be started at once and on site.",Case report,1,NR,29,M,NR,N,Sore throat (not specified),N,"Not specified [Antipyretic]; Alcohol consumption (6 pints, 1 day prior)",N,N,N,NR,N,N,Athletic,"Run 20.9km (8km behaving oddly, 12.9km collapse)",Run,Athletic (Physical Activity/Training/Exercise),Competitive Physical Activity (Athletic/Recreational),12.87472,NR,1982-08-01 00:00:00,19,30,4.886611974721044,,11.11,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,40,Hospital/Clinic Admission,N,,,,40,EHS,Fatal cardiac tamponade,Passed away,NR,,,,,,,,,,NR,N,,Y,N,,N,Y,,N,Y,N,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,Y,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,Y,,,,,N,N,N,,N,N,,,N,N,,,,,N,N,,N,N,,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,,Y,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,,,,N,N,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,,,N,,N,,,,,,N,N,Y,N,N,N,Y,N,Y,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,,Y,Y,,Y,N,,,,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,Y,Y,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,,,,,N,N,N,N,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,N,Y,N,,,,,,,,,,,,Y,,,,,N,N,Y,N,N,N,N,Y,,N,N,N,N,,,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,140,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,,,90,30,,N,N,7.33,N,N,36,74,N,N,N,N,18,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,,,,,,,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,26,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,<0.8,N,N,N,N,32,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,,,Y,,N,N,,,,,,,,,,,,N,,N,N,N,N,N,,,,,,N,,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,,N,N,,,,,,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,,N,N,,,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,N,Y,Y,N,N,Y,N,N,Y,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,Y,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,,,,,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,,,,,N,N,N,N,,,N,,,,,,,N,N,,N,,,N,N,N,N,,,,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,,,,,,,,N,N,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,,,N,,Y,N,N,,,Y,,,,,,,,,,,N,N,,,,,,,,,,Y,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,,,N,N,Y,N,,,780,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,,,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,,,,,,N,,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,40.0

Chest  computed tomography revealed bilateral infiltrates, and tests for urinary  pneumococcal antigens were positive. He was diagnosed with heatstroke preceded by  pneumococcal pneumonia. He was subsequently treated with antibiotics, and body  surface cooling was performed. A diffusion-weighted brain MRI performed on day  eight revealed abnormal bilateral hyperintensities from the cortex at the frontal  lobe apex of the subcortex. Moreover, he had reduced spontaneity, dysarthria,  nystagmus, tremor, and ataxia of both the upper limbs. He was diagnosed with  heatstroke encephalopathy.

EHI can involve multiple  organs of the body, including the muscles, kidneys and brain; however, myocardium  involvement is infrequent. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We present the case of a  26-year-old male construction worker who worked outdoors in a hot arid  environment. He presented with acute kidney injury and rhabdomyolysis and was  diagnosed with EHI. During his hospital stay, he developed complete heart block,  and cardiac MRI showed features of myocarditis. Work-up to identify other  aetiologies of myocarditis was normal. This case highlights the effects of EHI on  the myocardium. CONCLUSION: It is important to keep in mind the various effects  of EHI on the myocardium. Myocarditis due to EHI is rare, and conduction defects  resulting from it might persist, necessitating specialist intervention.

A 20-year-old man with a history of morbid  obesity, hypertension, and schizophrenia was admitted to our intensive care unit  because of multiorgan failure due to severe heat stroke. He had been working  under the sun. Treatment included aggressive body cooling but, in spite of the  best supportive care, the patient succumbed in a few hours. We concluded that the  adverse event was possibly associated with his obesity and the use of  antipsychotics. Histological evaluation revealed lesions consistent with severe  hyperthermia and shock. Conclusions. Heat stroke is an uncommon clinical entity  characterized by systemic heat and loss of the body's normal mechanisms for  dealing with heat stress, such as sweating and temperature control. When heat  stroke is diagnosed early and supportive care begins promptly the prognosis is  optimal but it becomes a life-threatening disease when treatment is delayed. Lack  of physical acclimatization and the use of certain medications that interfere  with salt and water balance can impair thermoregulation under conditions of high  environmental temperature.

Which stage to perform the liver  transplantation for severe hepatic failure in EHS is still obscure at clinical  setting. The conservative management has been reported to be successful in  treating heat-stroke-associated AHF even in the presence of accepted criteria for  emergency liver transplantation. Case Presentation. Here, we reported a  35-year-old male who presented with very high transaminases, hyperbilirubinemia,  significant prolongation of the prothrombin time, and coma. No other causes for  AHF could be identified but physical exhaustion and hyperthermia. Although the  current patient fulfilled London criteria for emergency liver transplantation, he  spontaneously recovered under conservative treatment including intravenous  fluids, cooling, diuretics as mannitol, and hepatocyte growth-promoting factors.

We hereby present a case of a 25-year-old male  presenting with syncope after a 10â€‰ km run in 28Â°C outside temperature who  developed acute liver failure. Case Presentation. Initial temperature was found  to be 41.1Â°C, and cooling measures were rapidly applied. He suffered from acute  renal failure and rhabdomyolysis and proceeded to acute liver failure (ASAT  6100â€‰U/l and ALAT 6561â€‰U/l) due to hypoxic hepatitis on day 3. He did not meet  criteria for emergency liver transplantation and recovered on supportive care.

The very young and debilitated on the one  hand and healthy individuals under considerable physical stress on the other are  vulnerable to heat stroke. Post-mortem findings will depend on the time lapse  between the stroke event and death. We report on the deaths resulting from heat  stroke in a 12-month-old baby and three 19-year-old soldiers. Reconstruction of  the environmental conditions enables elucidation of the circumstances that  precipitated exogenous hyperpyrexia. The Discomfort Index presents reliable  criteria for the assessment of heat load: values above 28 units are considered as  severe heat load and are life threatening.

Mild hepatic involvement is often observed in these patients; however, fulminant  liver failure may occur in approximately 5% of all cases.

Three patients underwent liver  transplantation, 1 recovered spontaneously, and 1 patient died on day 11  following the exertion.

Appropriate  diagnosis-finding, fast initiation of cooling and intensive care are key measures  of the initial treatment. Scientific case report based on i) clinical experiences  obtained in the clinical management of a particularly rare case and ii) selected  references from the medical scientific literature. CASE PRESENTATION: We present  a case of a young and healthy construction worker who suffered from an exertional  heat stroke with a body core temperature exceeding 42â€¯Â°C by previous several hour  work at 35â€¯Â°C ambient temperature. Heat stroke was associated with foudroyant,  not reversible multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, in particular, early  disturbed coagulation, microcirculatory, liver and respiratory failure, and  subsequent fatal outcome despite immediate diagnosis-finding, rapid external  cooling and expanded intensive care management.

DOI: 10.1186/s40696-015-0010-3",28265433,10.1186/s40696-015-0010-3,"BACKGROUND: The common practice in the Israel defense Forces is that exertional heat related injury patients undergo a heat tolerance test 6-8Â weeks post event  as part of the ""return to duty"" process. In the case of a positive heat tolerance  test the individual is classified as heat intolerant, in some cases however, the  thermoregulatory recovery may be longer (several months), and therefore a second  heat tolerance test is scheduled 6-8Â weeks later. The presented case reports  emphasize the possibility of different recovery periods of the thermoregulatory  center and the distinction between congenital and acquired physiological heat  intolerance. CASE DESCRIPTION: Two young healthy males (A and B) were diagnosed  with exertional heat related injury during a pre-recruitment sorting process.  Both underwent a heat tolerance test, and were found heat intolerant. During the  next months they repeated the test several times. Patient A was finally diagnosed  as heat tolerant and patient B was diagnosed as heat intolerant.

In the case of a positive heat tolerance  test the individual is classified as heat intolerant, in some cases however, the  thermoregulatory recovery may be longer (several months), and therefore a second  heat tolerance test is scheduled 6-8Â weeks later. The presented case reports  emphasize the possibility of different recovery periods of the thermoregulatory  center and the distinction between congenital and acquired physiological heat  intolerance. CASE DESCRIPTION: Two young healthy males (A and B) were diagnosed  with exertional heat related injury during a pre-recruitment sorting process.  Both underwent a heat tolerance test, and were found heat intolerant. During the  next months they repeated the test several times. Patient A was finally diagnosed  as heat tolerant and patient B was diagnosed as heat intolerant. CONCLUSION:  Susceptibility to heat is a significant determinant for active young people such  as athletes and soldiers. Both cases emphasize the importance of the heat  tolerance test (and repeated test when needed) as a criteria for an exertional  heat related injury patient to return to duty/play and to perform intense  physical activities.

The onset was marked by sudden loss of consciousness, sometimes preceded briefly by irrational behaviour. All but 1 were profusely sweating at the time of collapse. Body temperatures, examined after a variable delay, exceeded 40[degree]C in all but 4. Diarrhoea, vomiting, convulsions, and hypotension were common during the 1st few hr. The course during the 12 hr. after collapse made apparent whether the heat injury was fatal, severe, or mild. Seven fatal cases were unconscious, except for brief lucid intervals, until their deaths within 65 hr. These showed severe disturbances in blood coagulation. In the 12 severe cases unconsciousness lasted an average of 5-1/2 hr. and never exceeded 10 hr. These patients evidenced hepatic and renal damage, elevation of many serum enzymes, and disturbances of clotting mechanism. All survived, frequently after a stormy course and sometimes with neurological residua. The 8th fatal case, actually 1 of severe heatstroke, succumbed on the 31st day to renal and hepatic failure. In the 16 mild cases unconsciousness never exceeded 3 hr. and in the majority was less than 1 hr. Evidence of other system involvement was transient. The body temperature frequently fell spontaneously. Therapy included rapid cooling (under cover of sedation to prevent convulsions and shivering); management of water and electrolyte imbalance; the use of fresh blood and plasma to correct clotting defects; and haemodialysis in 2 cases. Autopsy findings were uniform in all cases and consisted of multiple petechiae in numerous organs and grosser haemorrhages, congestion, and widespread cellular degeneration. Heatstroke occurs when elevated body temperature becomes a cellular noxin. The body temperature rises when the heat load exceeds the capacity of the heat-dissipating mechanisms. In these cases the critical role of the increased metabolic heat (physical exertion) in overwhelming a normal heat-dissipating mechanism, as evidenced by profuse sweating, is demonstrated. In the setting of physical exertion in hot weather, the collapse with fever of a previously healthy individual should a priori be diagnosed as heatstroke, unless another cause is obvious.

Body temperatures, examined after a variable delay, exceeded 40[degree]C in all but 4. Diarrhoea, vomiting, convulsions, and hypotension were common during the 1st few hr. The course during the 12 hr. after collapse made apparent whether the heat injury was fatal, severe, or mild. Seven fatal cases were unconscious, except for brief lucid intervals, until their deaths within 65 hr. These showed severe disturbances in blood coagulation. In the 12 severe cases unconsciousness lasted an average of 5-1/2 hr. and never exceeded 10 hr. These patients evidenced hepatic and renal damage, elevation of many serum enzymes, and disturbances of clotting mechanism. All survived, frequently after a stormy course and sometimes with neurological residua. The 8th fatal case, actually 1 of severe heatstroke, succumbed on the 31st day to renal and hepatic failure. In the 16 mild cases unconsciousness never exceeded 3 hr. and in the majority was less than 1 hr. Evidence of other system involvement was transient. The body temperature frequently fell spontaneously. Therapy included rapid cooling (under cover of sedation to prevent convulsions and shivering); management of water and electrolyte imbalance; the use of fresh blood and plasma to correct clotting defects; and haemodialysis in 2 cases. Autopsy findings were uniform in all cases and consisted of multiple petechiae in numerous organs and grosser haemorrhages, congestion, and widespread cellular degeneration. Heatstroke occurs when elevated body temperature becomes a cellular noxin. The body temperature rises when the heat load exceeds the capacity of the heat-dissipating mechanisms. In these cases the critical role of the increased metabolic heat (physical exertion) in overwhelming a normal heat-dissipating mechanism, as evidenced by profuse sweating, is demonstrated. In the setting of physical exertion in hot weather, the collapse with fever of a previously healthy individual should a priori be diagnosed as heatstroke, unless another cause is obvious.

Seven fatal cases were unconscious, except for brief lucid intervals, until their deaths within 65 hr. These showed severe disturbances in blood coagulation. In the 12 severe cases unconsciousness lasted an average of 5-1/2 hr. and never exceeded 10 hr. These patients evidenced hepatic and renal damage, elevation of many serum enzymes, and disturbances of clotting mechanism. All survived, frequently after a stormy course and sometimes with neurological residua. The 8th fatal case, actually 1 of severe heatstroke, succumbed on the 31st day to renal and hepatic failure. In the 16 mild cases unconsciousness never exceeded 3 hr. and in the majority was less than 1 hr. Evidence of other system involvement was transient. The body temperature frequently fell spontaneously. Therapy included rapid cooling (under cover of sedation to prevent convulsions and shivering); management of water and electrolyte imbalance; the use of fresh blood and plasma to correct clotting defects; and haemodialysis in 2 cases. Autopsy findings were uniform in all cases and consisted of multiple petechiae in numerous organs and grosser haemorrhages, congestion, and widespread cellular degeneration. Heatstroke occurs when elevated body temperature becomes a cellular noxin. The body temperature rises when the heat load exceeds the capacity of the heat-dissipating mechanisms. In these cases the critical role of the increased metabolic heat (physical exertion) in overwhelming a normal heat-dissipating mechanism, as evidenced by profuse sweating, is demonstrated. In the setting of physical exertion in hot weather, the collapse with fever of a previously healthy individual should a priori be diagnosed as heatstroke, unless another cause is obvious.

The body temperature frequently fell spontaneously. Therapy included rapid cooling (under cover of sedation to prevent convulsions and shivering); management of water and electrolyte imbalance; the use of fresh blood and plasma to correct clotting defects; and haemodialysis in 2 cases. Autopsy findings were uniform in all cases and consisted of multiple petechiae in numerous organs and grosser haemorrhages, congestion, and widespread cellular degeneration. Heatstroke occurs when elevated body temperature becomes a cellular noxin. The body temperature rises when the heat load exceeds the capacity of the heat-dissipating mechanisms. In these cases the critical role of the increased metabolic heat (physical exertion) in overwhelming a normal heat-dissipating mechanism, as evidenced by profuse sweating, is demonstrated. In the setting of physical exertion in hot weather, the collapse with fever of a previously healthy individual should a priori be diagnosed as heatstroke, unless another cause is obvious. Adherence to such false criteria, as any arbitrary minimum body temperature or absence of sweating can only delay proper management and deleteriously influence the outcome.",Case series,36,NR,19,M,NR,Y,N,N,N,N,N,N,NR,N,N,Occupational,"Military training [strenuous physical activity, running or marching and often carrying a 10-20kg load] (8km)",Loaded Physical Training/Exercise (Unspecified),Occupational (Training/Test/Exercise/Course),Military Training (Occupational),8,NR,1956-1966,31,62,19.860449352733706,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,40,NR,N,,,,40.6,EHS,Nil,Recovered,NR,,,,,,,,,,NR,N,,N,Y,,N,N,,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,,,,,N,N,N,,N,N,,,N,N,,,,,N,N,,N,N,,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,,,,N,N,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,,,N,,N,,,,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,,N,N,,,N,,,,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,Y,N,N,,,,,N,N,N,N,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Y,N,N,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,,,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,,,N,N,,N,N,N,N,15.2,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,,N,,N,143,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,,,,,,,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,2.7,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,100,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,,,N,,N,N,,Y,,,,,,,,,,N,,N,N,N,N,N,,,,,,N,,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,38,N,N,,N,N,,N,N,,,,,,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,8.5518,N,N,N,N,,,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,,N,N,,,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,N,Y,N,N,N,N,Y,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,,,,,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,,,,,N,N,N,N,,,N,,,,,,,N,N,,N,,,N,N,N,N,,,,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,,,,,,,,N,N,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,,,N,,N,N,N,,,N,,,,,,,,,,,N,N,,,,,,,,,,N,N,N,N,N,Y,N,N,N,N,N,Y,N,Y,N,N,N,N,,,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,,,N,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,N,10.323,N,N,N,N,N,N,120,3.4,N,N,N,92,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,,,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,,,,,,N,,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,40.0

Clinical features:  A 29-year-old Rugby League forward with a mild infection of the upper respiratory tract collapsed while playing football in late March, when the ambient temperature was 24.1-degrees-C and the relative humidity up to 73%.  He was initially thought to have sustained a head injury and was markedly dehydrated.  He suffered severe disseminated intravascular coagulation and gross neurological, renal and hepatic disturbances. Intervention and outcome:  He required repeated haemodialysis, assisted ventilation and supportive therapy and remained unconscious for 10 days.  He then Recovered fully. Conclusion:  Heat stroke is potentially fatal and can be easily mistaken for head injury in contact sports.  When players are dehydrated, have febrile illness and play in warm conditions, they may succumb to heat stroke.",Case Study,1,NR,29,M,29.53,N,Acute coryza (3 days prior),Traumatic osteoarthritis of the right knee; Ross River fever (18 months prior); Recurrent sinusitis,Oxymetazoline Hydrochloride(0.05%) [Nasal Decongestant]; Pseudoephedrine(60mg) [Nasal Decongestant],N,N,N,Overweight,N,N,Occupational,Professional Rugby League match 80min (67min),Rugby,Athletic (Physical Activity/Training/Exercise),Athletic (Physical Activity/Training/Exercise),NR,67m,1991-03-01 00:00:00,24.1,73,15.972047804860406,,,,,,,40.7,,,,,,,,,,,Hospital/Clinic Admission,N,,,,NR,EHS,"disseminated intravascular coagulation caused

Methods: We reviewed our institutional experience with emergency hepatectomy followed by transplantation for fulminant liver failure over a twenty-year period. A retrospective review of a prospectively maintained liver transplant database was undertaken at a national liver transplant centre. Demographic data, clinical presentation, preoperative investigations, cardiocirculatory parameters, operative and postoperative data were recorded.

Results: In the study period, six two-stage liver transplants were undertaken. Indications for transplantation included acute paracetamol poisoning (n = 3), fulminant hepatitis A (n = 1), trauma (n = 1) and exertional heat stroke (n = 1). Anhepatic time ranged from 330 to 2640 min. All patients demonstrated systemic inflammatory response syndrome in the first post-operative week and the incidence of sepsis was high at 50%. There was one mortality, secondary to cardiac arrest 12 h following re-perfusion. Two patients required re-transplantation secondary to arterial thrombosis. At a median follow-up of 112 mo, 5 of 6 patients are alive and without evidence of graft dysfunciton.

Conclusion: Two-stage liver transplantation represents a safe and potentially life-saving treatment for carefully selected exceptional cases of fulminant hepatic failure.",Case series,1,Ireland,41,M,,Y,,,,,N,,,,,Athletic,Ultra-marathon (NR),Run,Athletic (Physical Activity/Training/Exercise),Competitive Physical Activity (Athletic/Recreational),NR,NR,NR,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,9.2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Y,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,7.15,,,,,,,,,13.3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,15.8,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Y,,Y,,Y,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,136,5.5,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The clearance of myoglobin and albumin at 5 minutes, and at 4, 12,and 24 hours were calculated. The serum myoglobin level decreased from a peak of 25,400 ng/mLon admission to 133 ng/mL at discharge. During HCO-CVVHD, the mean clearances of serummyoglobin at four timepoints were 61.3 (range, 61.0–61.6), 52.3 (38.9–65.8), 47.3 (46.8–47.9), and43.7 (39.5–48.0) mL/min, respectively, and the mean clearances of albumin were 12.4 (range,11.8–13.1), 3.1 (2.5–3.8), 1.2 (1.0–1.4), and 0.8 (0.6–1.0) mL/min, respectively. During CVVH, theclearance rates of myoglobin at 5 minutes and 24 hours were 17.0 and 3.8 mL/min, respectively,with a negligible clearance of albumin.

We report the case of a patient who developed a severe post-exertional heat stroke with consecutive multiple organ dysfunction resistant to conventional antipyretic treatment, necessitating the use of a novel endovascular device to combat hyperthermia and maintain normothermia.

Methods
A 38-year-old male suffering from severe heat stroke with predominant signs and symptoms of encephalopathy requiring acute admission to an intensive care unit, was admitted to a ten-bed neurological intensive care unit of a tertiary care hospital. The patient developed consecutive multiple organ dysfunction with rhabdomyolysis, and hepatic and respiratory failure. Temperature elevation was resistant to conventional treatment measures. Aggressive intensive care treatment included forced diuresis and endovascular cooling to combat hyperthermia and maintain normothermia.

Results
Analyses of serum revealed elevation of proinflammatory cytokines (TNF alpha, IL-6), cytokines (IL-2R), anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-4) and chemokines (IL-8) as well as signs of rhabdomyolysis and hepatic failure. Aggressive intensive care treatment as forced diuresis and endovascular cooling (CoolGard® and CoolLine®) to combat hyperthermia and maintain normothermia were used successfully to treat this severe heat stroke.

Conclusion
In this case of severe heat stroke, presenting with multiple organ dysfunction and elevation of cytokines and chemokines, which was resistant to conventional cooling therapies, endovascular cooling may have contributed significantly to the reduction of body temperature and, possibly, avoided a fatal result.",Case report,1,Austria,38,M,24,Y,N,N,N,,N,,,,,Recreational,Hiking tour (NR),Hiking,Athletic (Physical Activity/Training/Exercise),Competitive Physical Activity (Athletic/Recreational),NR,NR,2003-07-01 00:00:00,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,40.8,,,Hospital/Clinic Admission,Y,38.7,Urinary Bladder,20h post hospital admission,40,EHS,"multiple organ dysfunction , hepatic failure, rhabdomyolysis, respiratory failure",Recovered,NR,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Y,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,102.4,,,33.124,,,,,"peak myoglobin: Day 2

Extreme hyperthermia (over 40.5 °C), central nervous system failure, multiorgan dysfunction, and hypovolemic shock are the hallmarks of the clinical presentation of heatstroke. A 27-year-old male was presented to the causality with loss of consciousness followed by altered sensorium while working outdoors (outside temperature was 40°C), low blood pressure (70/50 mmHg), hyperthermia (41°C), tachycardia, focal seizures (1 episode), hypovolemic shock. At presentation, the Glasgow Coma Scale was E1V1M1, and he was intubated, moved to the intensive care unit, and monitored closely. He was treated with antibiotics, anticonvulsants, intravenous fluids, vasopressor supports, and body surface cooling methods. The hematological investigations showed thrombocytopenia, deranged liver, and renal function tests. On day 1, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain showed normal study. As the patient's neurological status showed no improvement MRI of the brain was repeated on day 8 which showed restricted diffusion with hyperintensities involving bilateral caudate nuclei, anterior aspects of bilateral putamen, and insular cortex, suggesting to rule out infective encephalopathy.

However, atypical presentations can also occur, leading to significant complications such as hemolytic anemia and organ dysfunction. CASE SUMMARY: This case report describes a male patient who experienced moderate-to-severe anemia that was difficult to correct, with a confirmed diagnosis of microangiopathic hemolytic anemia accompanying multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, indicative of critical EHS. Despite intensive resuscitation efforts, the patient's condition deteriorated, necessitating admission to the intensive care unit for advanced management. CONCLUSION: This case highlights the importance of recognizing atypical presentations of EHS, particularly that with significant hemolytic anemia and concurrent organ failure. Clinicians should maintain a high level of suspicion for these complications in patients displaying symptoms of heat-related illness, especially when caused by strenuous activity, as early diagnosis and intervention are crucial to improve patient outcomes.",Case study,1,China,25,M,25.65,y,,,,,,,,,,Recreational,5km training run,Run,Recreational (Physical Activity/Training/Exercise),Competitive Physical Activity (Athletic/Recreational),4.8,54 minutes,2023-07-23 00:00:00,28,66,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,40.3,Pre-treatment,N,,,,40,EHS,,Recovered,NR,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,y,,,,,,,,,,,,y,,Y,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,y,,,,,y,,,335500,,69.6,3000,,,,,,Y,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Y,Y,,,,,,,y,,,,,,,,,,,,,Y,,Y,,,,,,,,,,,,,,y,Y,,,,,,,,,Y,,,,Y,,Y,,N,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Y,,,,Y,,,,Y,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Y,,,,,,y,,,,,Y,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,140,,,,,,,,,1.1,2937,,,,,,,80,50,,,,,89,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,21.65,,,,,,44,8.2,0.0663,,,,,,,7320,,,,134,505,5.62,,,,7.5,,,,,,,17,,,,45,,,15,,,,,,,,1.38,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Y,,,,,,,,,,,,,,32.8,,,,,,,,1.01,,,,,,,Y,,,,,Y,Y,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,y,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,y,,,,,y,,,,,y,,,,,,,7.4,,2830,,1630,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,265,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1444,,,,,,,,,y,y,,,,Y,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,y,,,,y,y,,,,,,,,y,,,,,,,,,,,40,,,,,,y,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,y,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,y,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Y,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,y,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,y,,,,,335,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,y,,,,,40.3

Heat stroke (HS) is a critical condition resulting from extreme temperatures, often culminating in multiorgan dysfunction. Clinical manifestations of heat-related emergencies can include altered mentation, fever, and profound weakness. We present a compelling case of a previously healthy 49-year-old male who developed altered mentation, fever, and acute kidney injury following intense physical exertion amidst a severe heat wave. Although initially managed as heat stroke, the patient soon exhibited dysarthria, palatal weakness, and bilateral lower limb weakness with areflexia, prompting a detailed neurological assessment. Electromyography and nerve conduction studies revealed the acute motor-sensory axonal neuropathy (AMSAN) variant of Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS), an uncommon but severe sequel of heat stroke. GBS, an autoimmune disorder, typically presents with ascending bilateral lower limb flaccid paralysis, often following an acute infectious trigger. Treatment with plasmapheresis led to remarkable neurological recovery. This case represents the first documented instance of heat stroke-induced GBS in Pakistan, highlighting both the distinctive clinical features and the therapeutic complexities of this rare condition.",Case study,1,Pakistan,49,M,,y,,,,,,,,,,Recreational,Physical activity (unspecified),Physical activity (Unspecfied),Recreational (Physical Activity/Training/Exercise),Physical activity (Unspecfied),NR,NR,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,40,Pre-treatment,N,,,,,EHS,Gullian Barre syndrome s,Recovered,NR,,,,,,,,,,,y,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,y,,,,,,y,,Y,,,,,,,,,y,,,,,,,y,,,,,,,2427,,,,,,,,,Y,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Y,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Y,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Y,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Y,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,y,,,,,,,,145,,,,,,,397000,,,,,,,,,,90,60,,,,,97,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,8,,,,,,210,14,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,20,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1.99,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Y,,,,,,,,y,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.1,,,,,,y,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,5,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,y,,,,,,y,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,y,,,,,,,y,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,6,,,,,,,,0.23,3.61,,,,0.001,,1,3,,,Y,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Y,,,,,Y,,,Y,,,,,,,y,y,y,,y,,,,,y,,,,,,,,,,,,,170.6,,,,,30,,,,,,123,3.4,95,,,0.2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1.03,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,40.0

OBJECTIVES: This case study assessed the practicality of the ice towel method in an industrial setting, where criteria for use include cost effectiveness, portability, scalability, and implementation by a single worker under the stress of an emergency. METHODS: This case study describes the emergency application of the ice towel method while awaiting paramedics, for a worker suffering suspected exertional heat stroke on a remote job site. RESULTS: Ice towels were able to be transported to a remote field site and applied successfully by a single worker under the stress of a potentially life-threatening emergency.
