DOI: 10.55460/4TIV-HQLO","Exertional heat stroke (EHS) is a medical emergency characterized by elevated body temperature and central nervous system dysfunction, and it can include dizziness, confusion and loss of consciousness, as well as long-term organ and tissue damage. EHS is distinct from classic, or passive, heat stroke and is most commonly observed during intense physical activity in warfighters, athletes, and laborers. EHS is an ongoing non-combat threat that represents a risk to both the health and readiness of military personnel. Potential risk factors and their mitigation have been the subject of investigation for decades. One risk factor that is often mentioned in the literature, but not well quantified, is that of individual motivation to excel, wherein highly trained military personnel and athletes exert themselves beyond their physiological limits because of a desire to complete tasks and goals. The motivation to excel in tasks with high standards of achievement, such as those within elite military schools, appears to create an environment in which a disproportionately high number of exertional heat illness casualties occur. Here, we review existing biomedical literature to provide information about EHS in the context of motivation as a risk factor and then discuss five cases of EHS treated at Martin Army Community Hospital at Fort Moore, GA, from 2020 to 2022. In our discussion of the cases, we explore the influence of motivation on each occurrence. The findings from this case series provide further evidence of motivation to excel as a risk factor for EHS and highlight the need for creative strategies to mitigate this risk.",Case series,5,,24,F,NR,Y,N,N,N,N,N,N,NR,Y,N,Occupational,Ruck march 19.3km (completed),March,Occupational (Training/Test/Exercise/Course),Military Training (Occupational),19.31208,NR,9/1/20 0:00,21.9,92,21.3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,41.9,Pre-Treatment,Y,36.7,Unspecified,Hospital admission,40,EHS,Nil,Recovered,NR,,Y,,,,,,NR,N,,N,N,,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,,,,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,,,N,N,N,N,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,N,N,N,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,,,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,Y,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,N,Y,Y,N,N,Y,N,N,Y,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,Y,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,41.9

Here, we review existing biomedical literature to provide information about EHS in the context of motivation as a risk factor and then discuss five cases of EHS treated at Martin Army Community Hospital at Fort Moore, GA, from 2020 to 2022.

DOI: 10.3389/fmed.2024.1322126","Background: Heatstroke is a life-threatening disease clinically characterized by central nervous system dysfunction, multiorgan failure, and extreme hyperthermia. There are no reports about eye involvement in heat stroke. Here, we report a rare case of multilayered retinal hemorrhages in a patient with heatstroke. Case presentation: A 55-year-old male with a one-month history of blurry vision in both eyes presented at our department after suffering from heatstroke. His visual acuity was 5/20 OD and 10/20 OS. Fundus examination revealed retinal hemorrhages in both eyes. Fundus autofluorescence images and near-infrared reflectance images revealed well-defined retinal lesions. Optical coherence tomography helped to accurately locate the different layers of the lesions, including the nerve fiber layer, sub-inner limiting membrane, outer plexiform layer, ellipsoid zone and Henle fiber layer hemorrhages. We followed up with the patient for 8 months. At the last follow-up, his visual acuity was 20/20 in both eyes, and fundus examination showed that retinal hemorrhages were almost completely absorbed. Conclusion: To our knowledge, this is the first report on multilayered retinal hemorrhages secondary to heat stroke. Intraretinal and preretinal hemorrhages can gradually resolve, and the patientâ€™s vision will improve with the absorption of the retinal hemorrhages. Multimodal imaging may help to reveal additional details about retinal lesions and monitor the course of the disease.",Case report,1,,55,M,NR,Y,N,N,N,N,N,N,NR,N,N,Occupational,Outdoor work (3h),Outdoor Work,Outdoor Occupational (Physical Work/Labour/Agriculture Work/Farm Work),Outdoor Physical Work/Labour (Occupational),NR,3h,2022,40,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,39.8,Hospital/Clinic Admission,N,,,,NR,EHS,Acute retinal hemorrhages,Recovered,NR,,,,,,,,NR,N,,N,N,Y,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,Y,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,Y,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,Y,N,,,,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,,,N,N,Y,N,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Y,N,N,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,159,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,111,59,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,15,10.6,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,1.26,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,Y,,,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,Y,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,410,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,Y,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,Y,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,N,Y,N,N,Y,Y,N,N,Y,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,Y,Y,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,11.5,11.1,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,39.8

DOI: 10.1097/MD.0000000000036676","Rationale: Heat-related illnesses have protean manifestations that can mimic other life-threatening conditions. The diagnosis of heat stroke requires a high index of suspicion if the patient has been exposed to a high-temperature environment. Central nervous system dysfunction is a cardinal feature. Strict adherence to temperature criteria can potentially lead to misdiagnosis. Patient concerns: A 37-year-old construction worker was brought in by his wife and coworker due to a sudden loss of consciousness while resting after completing his work. Diagnoses: Due to challenges faced during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, as well as language barriers, a detailed history from the coworker who witnessed the patient's altered sensorium was not available. He was initially suspected of having encephalitis and brainstem stroke. However, subsequent investigations revealed multiorgan dysfunction with a normal brain computed tomography and cerebral computed tomography angiogram. In view of the multiple risk factors for heat stroke, pupillary constriction, and urine color suggestive of rhabdomyolysis, a diagnosis of heat stroke was made. Interventions: Despite delayed diagnosis, the patient's multiorgan dysfunction recovered within days with basic supportive care. Outcomes: There were no noticeable complications on follow-up 14 months later. Lessons: Heat stroke can be easily confused with other neurological pathologies, particularly if no history can be obtained from the patient or informant. When approaching a comatose patient, we propose that serum creatinine kinase should be considered as an initial biochemical screening test.",Case report,1,,37,M,NR,N,"Headache, back pain and generalised weakness and no fever (1 day prior); Feeling of vague, indescribable discomfort, general malaise (day of incident)",N,N,N,N,N,NR,N,N,Occupational,Construction work (9h),Construction Work,Outdoor Occupational (Physical Work/Labour/Agriculture Work/Farm Work),Outdoor Physical Work/Labour (Occupational),NR,9h,1/1/22 0:00,,,,,,,,,,,,,36.8,,,,,Hospital/Clinic Admission,N,,,,40,EHS,Nil,Recovered,NR,,,,,,,,NR,N,,N,N,,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,Y,Y,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,10566,14334,N,N,N,N,N,CK aNd CK-MB: DaY 2,Y,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,N,Y,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,Y,Y,,,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,Y,,,,Y,N,N,N,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,N,N,N,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,154,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,0.096,N,149,N,132,82,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,17.9,N,N,N,244,14.6,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,33.8,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,TropoNiN: DaY 3,N,N,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,Y,N,N,Y,,,,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,Y,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,186,939,69,1494,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,14.54,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,Y,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,N,Y,Y,N,N,Y,N,N,N,N,Y,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,Y,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,9,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,Y,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,Y,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,254.59,N,N,N,N,8.6,N,N,N,N,N,141,N,N,N,N,2.42,N,0.25,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,36.8

DOI: 10.1123/jsr.2022-0324","CONTEXT: Exertional heat stroke (EHS) is the most deadly form the exertional heat illness with a higher incidence among active duty US military members than in the general population. Current guidelines on EHS recovery timelines and return to duty vary among the military branches. In some cases, individuals experience prolonged heat and exercise intolerance with repeat exertional heat illness events, which can complicate the recovery process. Management and rehabilitation of such individuals is unclear. CASE PRESENTATION: This manuscript addresses the case and management of a US Air Force Special Warfare trainee who experienced 2 episodes of EHS, despite early recognition, gold standard treatment, and undergoing 4 weeks of a stepwise recovery after an initial EHS. MANAGEMENT AND OUTCOMES: After the second episode, a 3-step process was utilized, consisting of a prolonged and personalized recovery period, heat tolerance testing using Israeli Defense Force advanced modeling, and stepwise reacclimatization.

DOI: 10.1123/jsr.2022-0324","CONTEXT: Exertional heat stroke (EHS) is the most deadly form the exertional heat illness with a higher incidence among active duty US military members than in the general population. Current guidelines on EHS recovery timelines and return to duty vary among the military branches. In some cases, individuals experience prolonged heat and exercise intolerance with repeat exertional heat illness events, which can complicate the recovery process. Management and rehabilitation of such individuals is unclear. CASE PRESENTATION: This manuscript addresses the case and management of a US Air Force Special Warfare trainee who experienced 2 episodes of EHS, despite early recognition, gold standard treatment, and undergoing 4 weeks of a stepwise recovery after an initial EHS. MANAGEMENT AND OUTCOMES: After the second episode, a 3-step process was utilized, consisting of a prolonged and personalized recovery period, heat tolerance testing using Israeli Defense Force advanced modeling, and stepwise reacclimatization. This process allowed the trainee to successfully recover from repeat EHS and return to duty, and set a framework for future repeat EHS treatment guidelines. CONCLUSIONS: In individuals with repeat EHS, a prolonged recovery period followed by heat tolerance testing can be used to demonstrate appropriate thermotolerance and safely clear an individual to begin stepwise reacclimatization.

DOI: 10.23750/abm.v94iS1.14917","We report the case of a 52-year-old marathon runner admitted to our emergency department for exertional heat stroke (EHS). The electrocardiogram (ECG) showed a supraventricular tachycardia, probably an atrial flutter with a 2:1 block, conducted with a left bundle branch block. After 10 minutes of aggressive fluid management and rapid external cooling, the ECG returned to normal. As the high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I was elevated, coronary angiography and an electrophysiological study were performed, revealing normal coronary arteries, and excluding inducible arrhythmias. As reported in the current literature, our findings confirm that the electrocardiographic changes and elevation of cardiac markers in EHS do not reflect cardiac ischemia, but rather a myocardial injury due to the pathophysiological response to dehydration and hyperthermia, which markedly impaired stroke volume and cardiac output. EHS is a life-threatening condition with a complex pathophysiology caused by thermoregulatory failure. Diagnosis is not always straightforward, but early recognition and timely management (the â€œgolden hourâ€) with rapid cooling and intravenous fluids are crucial to prevent irreversible and fatal organ damage. EHS is defined by a rectal temperature > 40.5 Â°C with symptoms or signs of neurological dysfunction, such as confusion, drowsiness, or seizures, which can rapidly worsen with delirium, coma, and cardiac arrest. With this case report, we want to remind emergency physicians that early diagnosis and appropriate management of EHS can avoid death and inappropriate treatment.

DOI: 10.1093/milmed/usac124","The Seraph-100â„¢ is a purification filter that blunts cytokine storm, providing a more favorable environment to establish immune homeostasis. We present a novel case of compassionate use of Seraph filter in a young, healthy active duty service member with heat injury-induced massive inflammatory response. The patient is a previously healthy 26-year-old male with altered mental status, tachycardia, fever to 40.3 Â°C, and hypotension after losing consciousness during a 4-mile run. He had a history of one heat injury in college and took no medications or supplements. Initial workup demonstrated hemoconcentration, leukocytosis, and hyperkalemia. He was intubated, received isotonic crystalloid fluid, and was admitted to the intensive care unit. The patient developed vasopressor-resistant shock and multiorgan failure with rhabdomyolysis requiring continuous renal replacement therapy. The addition of the Seraph resulted in improved hemodynamic stability, decreased inflammatory markers, and improved organ function. Approximately 1 week after the final Seraph treatment, the patient had an abrupt massive lower gastrointestinal bleed and was transitioned to comfort care by family. We present the novel use of Seraph in the setting of multiorgan failure and hyperinflammatory state due to heat injury. The patient's vasopressor refractory distributive shock was believed to be secondary to heat stroke-induced massive inflammatory response, leading to a trial of Seraph therapy.

DOI: 10.1136/bjsports-2021-104081","OBJECTIVE: Exertional heat stroke (EHS), characterised by a high core body temperature (Tcr) and central nervous system (CNS) dysfunction, is a concern for athletes, workers and military personnel who must train and perform in hot environments. The objective of this study was to determine whether algorithms that estimate Tcr from heart rate and gait instability from a trunk-worn sensor system can forward predict EHS onset. METHODS: Heart rate and three-axis accelerometry data were collected from chest-worn sensors from 1806 US military personnel participating in timed 4/5-mile runs, and loaded marches of 7 and 12 miles; in total, 3422 high EHS-risk training datasets were available for analysis. Six soldiers were diagnosed with heat stroke and all had rectal temperatures of >41Â°C when first measured and were exhibiting CNS dysfunction. Estimated core temperature (ECTemp) was computed from sequential measures of heart rate. Gait instability was computed from three-axis accelerometry using features of pattern dispersion and autocorrelation. RESULTS: The six soldiers who experienced heat stroke were among the hottest compared with the other soldiers in the respective training events with ECTemps ranging from 39.2Â°C to 40.8Â°C.

DOI: 10.1136/bjsports-2021-104081","OBJECTIVE: Exertional heat stroke (EHS), characterised by a high core body temperature (Tcr) and central nervous system (CNS) dysfunction, is a concern for athletes, workers and military personnel who must train and perform in hot environments. The objective of this study was to determine whether algorithms that estimate Tcr from heart rate and gait instability from a trunk-worn sensor system can forward predict EHS onset. METHODS: Heart rate and three-axis accelerometry data were collected from chest-worn sensors from 1806 US military personnel participating in timed 4/5-mile runs, and loaded marches of 7 and 12 miles; in total, 3422 high EHS-risk training datasets were available for analysis. Six soldiers were diagnosed with heat stroke and all had rectal temperatures of >41Â°C when first measured and were exhibiting CNS dysfunction. Estimated core temperature (ECTemp) was computed from sequential measures of heart rate. Gait instability was computed from three-axis accelerometry using features of pattern dispersion and autocorrelation. RESULTS: The six soldiers who experienced heat stroke were among the hottest compared with the other soldiers in the respective training events with ECTemps ranging from 39.2Â°C to 40.8Â°C.

DOI: 10.1136/bjsports-2021-104081","OBJECTIVE: Exertional heat stroke (EHS), characterised by a high core body temperature (Tcr) and central nervous system (CNS) dysfunction, is a concern for athletes, workers and military personnel who must train and perform in hot environments. The objective of this study was to determine whether algorithms that estimate Tcr from heart rate and gait instability from a trunk-worn sensor system can forward predict EHS onset. METHODS: Heart rate and three-axis accelerometry data were collected from chest-worn sensors from 1806 US military personnel participating in timed 4/5-mile runs, and loaded marches of 7 and 12 miles; in total, 3422 high EHS-risk training datasets were available for analysis. Six soldiers were diagnosed with heat stroke and all had rectal temperatures of >41Â°C when first measured and were exhibiting CNS dysfunction. Estimated core temperature (ECTemp) was computed from sequential measures of heart rate. Gait instability was computed from three-axis accelerometry using features of pattern dispersion and autocorrelation. RESULTS: The six soldiers who experienced heat stroke were among the hottest compared with the other soldiers in the respective training events with ECTemps ranging from 39.2Â°C to 40.8Â°C. Combining ECTemp and gait instability measures successfully identified all six EHS casualties at least 3.5 min in advance of collapse while falsely identifying 6.1% (209 total false positives) examples where exertional heat illness symptoms were neither observed nor reported.

Results Versus successful finishers, EHI showed significantly higher NSE (10.33 [6.37, 20.00] vs. 3.17 [2.71, 3.92] ug.L-1, P<0.0001), cysC (1.48 [1.10, 1.67] vs. 1.10 [0.95, 1.21] mg.L-1, P = 0.0092) and copeptin (339.4 [77.0, 943] vs. 18.7 [7.1, 67.9] pmol.L-1, P = 0.0050).

DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0263873","Background Medical personnel may find it challenging to distinguish severe Exertional Heat Illness (EHI), with attendant risks of organ-injury and longer-term sequalae, from lesser forms of incapacity associated with strenuous physical exertion. Early evidence for injury at point-of-incapacity could aid the development and application of targeted interventions to improve outcomes. We aimed to investigate whether biomarker surrogates for end-organ damage sampled at point-of-care (POC) could discriminate EHI versus successful marathon performance. Methods Eight runners diagnosed as EHI cases upon reception to medical treatment facilities and 30 successful finishers of the same cool weather marathon (ambient temperature 8 rising to 12 ÂºC) were recruited.

DOI: 10.1097/MD.0000000000023159","Rationale:Unprecedented heatwaves over the past several years are getting worse with longer duration in the course of global warming. Heatstroke is a medical emergency with multiple organ involvement and life-threatening illness with a high mortality rate of up to 71%. Uncontrolled damage to the central nervous system can result in severe cerebral edema, permanent neurological sequelae, and death. However, regarding the therapeutic aspects of heat stroke, there was no therapeutic strategy after the rapid cooling of the core body temperature to <39Â°C to prevent further injury.Patient concerns:Each of 3 patients developed a change of mental statuses after the exposure to summer heatwaves or relatively high environmental temperatures with high humidity in the sauna.Diagnoses:The patients were diagnosed with severe heatstroke since they showed cerebral edema and multiple organ dysfunction based on the results from laboratory tests and the findings in brain computed tomography scan.Interventions:The patients underwent induced therapeutic hypothermia (<36Â°C) between 24 and 36 hours in the management of severe heatstroke.Outcomes:The patients survived from cerebral edema and multiple organ dysfunction.Lessons:We believe that targeted temperature management (<36Â°C) will help treat severe heatstroke. Thus it should be considered for reducing the chance of development of complications in multiple organs, especially in the central nervous system, when managing patients with severe heatstroke.",Case series,1,,21,M,NR,Y,N,N,N,N,N,N,NR,N,N,Occupational,March [22.7kg/50lb load] (NR),March,Occupational (Training/Test/Exercise/Course),Military Training (Occupational),NR,NR,NR,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,42.2,Pre-Treatment,Y,38.4,Unspecified,Hospital admission,40,EHS,Nil,Recovered,NR,,Y,,,,,,NR,N,,N,N,,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,Y,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,2000,N,N,N,N,N,N,,Y,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,Y,Y,Y,N,,,,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,,,N,N,N,N,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,N,N,N,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,200,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,70,40,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,,,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,Y,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,46,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,N,Y,Y,N,N,Y,N,N,Y,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,Y,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,Y,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,42.2

DOI: 10.1080/02640414.2020.1794256","Exertional heat stroke (EHS) is a potentially life-threatening condition with a variety of symptoms and abnormal laboratory findings. Nevertheless, data evaluating the course of making an EHS diagnosis in real-life practice, as well as the role of predisposing psychological components are limited. Thus, the aim of our study was to present a multi-faceted differentiation process and show the role of unhealthy competition in the development of EHS. We describe a case of a young amateur runner, admitted to the hospital due to loss of consciousness, further mental confusion, and increased body temperature above 40Â°C. Head scans excluded brain haemorrhage and stroke. Elevated troponin I levels suggested an acute coronary syndrome (ACS) or myocarditis. An increase of procalcitonin levels, signs of rhabdomyolysis and severe liver injury resulted in evaluation for infection and acute hepatic damage. Subsequently, the patient's negative results pointed us to a diagnosis of EHS. In-depth anamnesis revealed that the patient's excessive effort during the race was linked to the male-female competition. EHS can present diagnostic challenges, as it mimics various diseases, such as stroke, myocarditis, ACS, infection, or liver dysfunction.

DOI: 10.14309/01.ajg.0000712184.54035.44","INTRODUCTION: Exertional heat stroke (EHS) is a diagnosis of military significance given the hot and humid operational environments coupled with potential for poor outcomes if not diagnosed and treated timely. We present a case of EHS in a service-member (SM) resulting in acute liver failure (ALF). CASE DESCRIPTION/METHODS: A 34 year-old SM with a past medical history significant for severe alcohol use disorder who presented with EHS after going on a 3-mile unit run in 'boots and utes.' The SM was noted to have slurred speech and confusion afterwards prompting a visit to the ED. On initial evaluation he was noted to be obtunded with hypotension, tachycardia and a core temperature of 104o F. Following initial care with external cooling, the SM was transferred to our ICU and began to show signs of multi-organ dysfunction including acute encephalopathy, myocardial injury, acute kidney injury (AKI), anion gap metabolic acidosis, rhabdomyolysis, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and fulminant liver failure with AST/ALT of 16,400/4,820 respectively. Recognition of ALF secondary to EHS prompted our care team to refer the SM to a liver transplant center to be evaluated for an orthotropic liver transplant. DISCUSSION: According to the Armed Forces Health Surveillance Branch's annual update, 12,361 service members were reported to have heat related illness in 250 US military installations worldwide. Our case presents a SM with multiple risk factors for EHS including chronic alcohol use and deconditioning during the COVID-19 pandemic that lead to the development of ALF despite prompt diagnosis and treatment. Of note, literature review states that âˆ¼5% of heat stroke casualties experience ALF. Pathogenesis of ALF is thought to be secondary to a combination of direct thermal injury, gut ischemia from shunting of blood to the periphery and an inflammatory response from bacterial toxins translocated from the ischemic gut. Multiple prognostic risk assessments are used including the Model for End stage Liver Disease (MELD) and King's College Criteria to assess benefits of liver transplant. Our patient, despite only fulfilling 2 of 4 of the King's College Criteria, had a MELD score of 39 indicating a 52.6% 3-month mortality indicating a need for liver transplant.",Case report,1,,34,NR,NR,Y,N,Alcohol use disorder,N,N,N,N,NR,N,N,Occupational,Unit run 4.8km (completed),Run,Occupational (Training/Test/Exercise/Course),Military Training (Occupational),4.82802,NR,NR,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,40,Pre-Treatment,N,,,,NR,EHS,Multi-organ dysfunction,NR,NR,,,,,,,,NR,N,,N,N,Y,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,Y,,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,Y,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,Y,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,Y,N,,N,,,,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,Y,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,,,N,N,N,N,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,N,N,N,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,Y,N,N,,,,,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,16400,N,4820,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,Y,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,N,N,Y,N,N,N,N,N,Y,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,Y,N,N,N,N,N,Y,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,40

DOI: 10.1097/PHM.0000000000001291","Neurologic sequelae of heat stroke are prevalent among patients with severe heat stroke who require admission to an intensive care unit. Radiologic diagnosis of the condition is challenging because not every patient with clinical deficits shows abnormalities in computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging. In this case review, we report a patient who had been diagnosed with a severe heat stroke and showed gait disturbance, language disorder, and cognitive impairment although conventional magnetic resonance imaging did not reveal significant findings that correlated with his symptoms. Diffusion tensor tractography has been reported to be a useful tool for evaluating the neural status of white matter tracts across a wide range of conditions. The corticospinal tract, the corticoreticular pathway, the cingulum, the fornix, the medial lemniscus, and the arcuate fasciculus of the patient were reconstructed using diffusion tensor tractography. A narrowing, discontinuation, and decreased fractional anisotropy and fiber volume of the examined neural tracts were observed, which correlated well with his symptoms. These results suggest that diffusion tensor tractography might be a useful tool for the detection of neurologic deficits even when conventional brain magnetic resonance imaging reveals no significant abnormality and in establishing appropriate rehabilitation strategies for patients with neurologic symptoms after a heat stroke.",Case report,1,,43,M,NR,Y,N,N,N,N,N,N,NR,N,N,Occupational,Courier work (NR),Courier Work,Outdoor Occupational (Physical Work/Labour/Agriculture Work/Farm Work),Outdoor Physical Work/Labour (Occupational),NR,NR,2018,37.3,80.9,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,42.1,Pre-Treatment,N,,,,40,EHS,Nil,Recovered,NR,,Y,,,,,,NR,N,,N,N,,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,Y,N,N,N,N,Y,,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,,,,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,,,N,N,N,N,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,N,N,N,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,,,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,Y,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,Y,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,N,Y,Y,N,N,Y,N,N,Y,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,Y,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,Y,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,N,Y,N,N,N,N,N,N,Y,Y,Y,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,3,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,"Neural iNjurY

We present a case of heat stroke resulting in acute liver injury (ALI) successfully treated with intravenous N-acetylcysteine (NAC). Case presentation: A 24-year-old unresponsive male without significant past medical history presented to the emergency department with heat stroke; his initial temperature was 107.4 Â°F. During his hospital course, he developed ALI with significant elevation in aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, and total bilirubin. These laboratory findings peaked by hospital day two, but improved prior to discharge on hospital day five and throughout his follow up clinic visits. His treatment course included cooling measures, supportive care, supplemental oxygen and airway management, seizure control, and intravenous NAC therapy.

DOI: 10.1097/JNN.0000000000000488","BACKGROUND: Exertional heat stroke (EHS) is defined by a core body temperature that exceeds 40Â°C with associated central nervous system dysfunction, skeletal muscle injury, and multiple organ damage. The most important initial focus of treatment involves reduction of patient temperature. First approaches to achieve temperature reduction often include ice packs, water blankets, and cold intravenous fluid administration. When these measures fail, more advanced temperature management methods may be deployed but often require surgical expertise. Esophageal temperature management (ETM) has recently emerged as a new temperature management modality in which an esophageal heat transfer device replaces the standard orogastric tube routinely placed after endotracheal intubation and adds a temperature modulation capability. The objective of this case study is to report the first known use of ETM driven by bedside nursing staff in the treatment of EHS. METHOD: An ETM device was placed after endotracheal intubation in a 28-year-old man experiencing EHS over a 5-day course of treatment. RESULTS: Because the ETM device was left in place, when the patient experienced episodes of increasing temperature as high as 39.1Â°C, which required active cooling, nursing staff were able to immediately adjust the external heat exchange unit settings to achieve aggressive cooling at bedside. CONCLUSION: This nurse-driven technology offers a new means to rapidly deploy cooling to critically ill patients without needing to implement advanced surgical approaches or obstruct access to the patient, freeing the provider to continue optimal care in high-morbidity conditions.",Case report,1,,28,M,NR,Y,Muscle cramps (1 day prior),N,N,N,N,N,NR,N,N,Occupational,Firefighter training programme [uphill hike] (NR),Hike,Occupational (Training/Test/Exercise/Course), Training/Exercise (Occupational),NR,NR,2019,26.6667,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,41.7,Pre-Treatment,Y,40,Unspecified,Hospital admission,40,EHS,Encelphalopathy and rhabdomyolysis,Recovered,NR,,Y,,,,,,NR,N,,N,N,,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,Y,Y,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,155,1326,N,N,N,N,N,peak CK: DaY Not reported,Y,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,N,N,Y,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,,,,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,,,N,N,N,N,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Y,N,N,,,,,,,,,,,,,Y,,,,N,N,N,N,N,Y,N,,N,N,N,N,,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,150,N,N,N,N,N,N,320,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,51,N,N,N,N,N,198,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,1.94,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,Y,N,N,Y,,,,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,Y,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,38,>600,49,>600,N,N,79,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,Y,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,Y,Y,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,N,Y,Y,N,N,Y,N,N,Y,N,N,Y,N,N,N,N,N,Y,Y,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,Y,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,Y,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,197.13,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,141,5.4,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,41.7

DOI: 10.1155/2020/1305730","Heat stroke (HS) is a condition characterized by a rise in core body temperature and central nervous system dysfunction. It is divided into two types: classical and exertional. Exertional heat stroke (EHS) is accompanied by organ failure. Liver injury, presenting only with a rise in liver enzymes, is common but in rare conditions, acute liver failure (ALF) may ensue, leading to a potentially lethal condition. Most cases of EHS-induced ALF are managed conservatively. However, liver transplantation is considered for cases refractory to supportive treatment. Identifying patients eligible for liver transplantation in the context of an EHS-induced ALF becomes a medical dilemma since the conventional prognostic criterion may be difficult to apply, and there is paucity of literature about these specific sets of individuals. Recently, extracorporeal liver support has been gaining popularity for patients with liver failure as a bridge to liver transplant. In this case report, we present a young Filipino athlete with symptoms and clinical course consistent with EHS that developed multiorgan failure, initially considered a candidate for liver transplant and total plasma exchange, but clinically improved with supportive management alone.

DOI: 10.1016/j.jemermed.2019.03.025","Background: Exertional heat stroke (EHS) is a potentially life-threatening emergency requiring rapid reduction in core body temperature. Methods of cooling include cold water immersion, ice packs, cold water lavage, and chilled saline, among others. We report a case of EHS successfully cooled using an endovascular cooling device after traditional cooling methods failed to reduce core body temperature. Case Report: A 24-year old soldier collapsed during a 12-mile foot march while training in southern Georgia. His initial rectal temperature was 43.1Â°C (109.6Â°F). External cooling measures (ice sheet application) were initiated on site and Emergency Medical Services were called to transport to the hospital. Paramedics obtained a repeat rectal temperature of 42.4Â°C (108.4Â°F). Ice sheet application and chilled saline infusion were continued throughout transport to the Emergency Department (ED). Total prehospital treatment time was 50 min. Upon ED arrival, the patient's rectal temperature was 41.2Â°C (106.2Â°F). He was intubated due to a Glasgow Coma Scale score of 4, and endovascular cooling was initiated. Less than 45 minutes later his core body temperature was 37.55Â°C (99.6Â°F). He was admitted to the intensive care unit, where his mental status rapidly improved. He was found to have rising liver enzymes, and there was concern for his developing disseminated intravascular coagulation, prompting transfer to a tertiary care center.

DOI: 10.1186/s12883-019-1363-x","Background: Heat stroke (HS) is a critical illness that can cause multiple organ dysfunction, including damage to the central nervous system (CNS), which can be life-threatening in severe cases. Brain lesions in patients with HS who present with CNS damage have been rarely reported before, and they usually vary in different cases, hence, patients with such lesions may present a clinical challenge in terms of diagnosis and management. Cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT) is a rare cause of stroke that mostly affects young individuals and children. The pathogenesis of brain damage caused by HS is complex, and CVT may be involved in the pathogenesis of HS with CNS damage. In this manuscript, we have reported a case of a patient with HS having CVT with symmetrical lesions in the bilateral putamen, posterior limb of the internal capsule, external capsule, insular lobe, and subcortical white matter in the brain. Case presentation: We encountered a 48-year-old man who presented with HS in the summer season. During admission, he had a high body temperature and was in coma and shock. Then, he developed rhabdomyolysis syndrome, acute kidney and liver damage, electrolyte imbalance, and acid-base balance disorders, and his D-dimer level was elevated. After several days of anti-shock treatment, the patient's level of consciousness improved. However, he experienced a decline in vision. Cerebral magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed symmetrical lesions in the bilateral posterior limb of the internal capsule, putamen, external capsule, insula, and subcortical white matter, and cerebral magnetic resonance venography (MRV) showed the development of CVT. Therefore, anti-coagulation treatment was provided. After timely clinical intervention, the symptoms of the patient gradually improved. Conclusions: This case showed that HS can cause CVT. Therefore, cerebral MRI findings in HS must be assessed; in addition, early MRV can help in the diagnosis of the disease, which can effectively improve prognosis.",Case report,1,,48,M,NR,Y,N,N,N,N,N,N,NR,N,N,Occupational,Outdoor work (2h),Physical Work/Labour,Outdoor Occupational (Physical Work/Labour/Agriculture Work/Farm Work),Outdoor Physical Work (Occupational),NR,2h,7/1/18 0:00,35,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,40.2,Hospital/Clinic Admission,N,,,,40,EHS,"Rhabdomyolysis syndrome, acute kidney injury, hepatic disfunction, hyperkalemia, and metabolic acidosis",Recovered,NR,,Y,,,,,,NR,N,,N,N,,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,Y,,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,Y,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,Y,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,Y,Y,Y,N,,,,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,,,N,N,N,N,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,N,N,N,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,Y,,N,N,N,N,,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,100,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,75,40,N,N,N,95,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,1.022,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,Y,N,N,,,,,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,Y,Y,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,Y,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,Y,N,Y,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,N,Y,N,N,N,Y,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,Y,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,Y,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,210,1.87,N,N,N,N,267,"Neural iNjurY:

DOI: 10.1186/s40560-019-0359-3","Background: Heat stroke induces coagulofibrinolytic activation, which leads to life-threatening disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). However, treatment strategies for DIC in heat stroke have not yet been established, and also, the time course changes in coagulofibrinolytic markers have not been thoroughly evaluated. We report a severe heat stroke case with DIC who was eventually saved by anti-DIC treatments in accordance with changes in coagulofibrinolytic markers. Case presentation: A 45-year-old man was found unconscious outside, and his body temperature was elevated to 41.9 Â°C. For heat stroke, we performed an immediate tracheal intubation under the general anesthesia along with cooling by iced gastric lavage, cold fluid administration, and an intravascular cooling using Thermogardâ„¢. About 4 h after admission, his core temperature fell to 37 Â°C. We assessed coagulofibrinolytic biomarkers and treated in accordance with changes in these parameters. This case exhibited a biphasic change varying from an enhanced to a suppressed fibrinolytic type of DIC depending on the relative balance between fibrinolytic activation and the level of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1). In the early phase with consumption coagulopathy and enhanced fibrinolysis, we transfused a large amount of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) and platelets with tranexamic acid, an antifibrinolytic agent, possibly providing relief for the bleeding tendency. Anticoagulant therapy using recombinant human thrombomodulin-Î± (rh-TM-Î±) and antithrombin III (ATIII) concentrate was especially effective for DIC with a suppressed fibrinolytic phenotype in the later phase, after which organ failure that included severe hepatic failure was remarkably improved.

DOI: 10.1016/j.transproceed.2018.03.137","Heat stroke is a condition caused by an excessive increase in body temperature in a relatively short period of time, and is clinically characterized by central nervous system dysfunction, including delirium, seizures, coma, and severe hyperthermia. In this context, the resulting fulminant hepatic failure makes liver transplant the best choice when there are no guarantees of better results with conservative treatment. We present our experience in this case, possible alternative choices, and the current role of liver transplantation in the resolution of fulminant liver failure due to heat stroke. Case Report: We report the case of a 32-year-old man with a history of malabsorption syndrome and unconfirmed celiac disease controlled with a gluten-free diet, who, while working on a typical summer midday in southern Spain (approximately 40Â°C), abruptly presented with loss of consciousness, coma, and a temperature of 42Â°C, as well as seizures at the initial medical assessment that subsided after the administration of diazepam. On the third day, the patient presented with multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, requiring mechanical ventilation, hemodialysis, and inotropic support. He did not improve with the support of conservative treatment, therefore it was decided to perform an urgent liver transplant, after which he recovered completely.

DOI: 10.1016/j.transproceed.2018.07.019","Background: Exertional heatstroke is an extremely rare cause of fulminant hepatic failure. Maximal supportive care has failed to provide adequate survival in earlier studies. This is particularly true in cases accompanied by multiorgan failure. Methods and Materials: Our prospectively collected transplant database was retrospectively reviewed to identify patients undergoing liver transplantation for heatstroke between January 1, 2012, and December 31, 2016. We report 3 consecutive cases of male patients with fulminant hepatic failure from exertional heatstroke. Results: All patients developed multiorgan failure and required intubation, vasopressor support, and renal replacement therapy.

Three female military personnel fell unconscious almost simultaneously around noon after a long-distance march that had started at 6 AM. The fire department in Gotenba received a 119 call [at 1:16 PM] and requested dispatch of the eastern Shizuoka doctor helicopter (DH) because it would take about 1 hour from the scene to arrive at our hospital by ground ambulance. At that time, the DH of eastern Shizuoka was transporting an injured patient to Kanagawa Prefecture, so the flight dispatcher of the DH of eastern Shizuoka decided to request support DHs from Kanagawa Prefectures based on an agreement concerning collaboration using the DH. The DH of Kanagawa Prefecture met 1 of the patients and transported her to its base hospital.

External cooling was started immediately. The patient was intubated in view of a Glasgow Coma Scale of 7 and was transferred to theintensive therapy unit. Laboratory results revealed an acute kidney injury, rhabdomyolysis, disseminated intravascular coagulopathy and acute liver failure. The patient was encephalopathic, jaundiced and difficult to sedate. His liver function continued to deteriorate with alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels reaching 9207 U/L. King's Hospital Liver Centre, London was contacted for a possible liver transplant, and they advised an infusion of N-acetylcysteine. The following day liver function tests improved; thus, transplantation was not performed. The patient failed multiple sedation holds and required a tracheostomy. He continued to spike a fever. Despite no source of sepsis being found, the patient remained on broad spectrum antibiotics to cover for any potential infective causes until day 27. After 15 days, the patient's encephalopathy gradually improved. He was weaned off the ventilator and underwent intense physiotherapy.

DOI: 10.1093/milmed/usx105","Exertional heat illness and exercise-associated hyponatremia continue to be a problem in military and recreational events. Symptoms of hyponatremia can be mistaken for heat exhaustion or heat stroke. We describe three cases of symptomatic hyponatremia initially contributed to heat illnesses. The first soldier was a 31-yr-old female who ""took a knee"" at mile 6 of a 12-mile foot march. She had a core temperature of 100.9Â°F, a serum sodium level of 129 mmol/L, and drank approximately 4.5 quarts of water in 2 h. The second case was a 27-yr-old female soldier who collapsed at mile 11 of a 12-mile march. Her core temperature was 102.9Â°F and sodium level was 131 mmol/L. She drank 5 quarts in 2.5 h. The third soldier was a 27-yr-old male who developed nausea and vomiting while conducting an outdoor training event. His core temperature was 98.7Â°F and sodium level was 125 mmol/L. He drank 6 quarts in 2 h to combat symptoms of heat. All the three cases developed symptomatic hyponatremia by overconsumption of fluids during events lasting less than 3 h.

DOI: 10.1186/s13256-016-1184-0","Background: Exertional heatstroke is a life-threatening condition with high mortality because of the rapid progress of multiple organ dysfunction syndrome even if aggressive treatments are initiated rapidly. Mild to moderate hepatic injury is common in exertional heatstroke, while fulminant liver failure is rare. Extrapyramidal symptoms and pulmonary aspergillosis secondary to liver failure induced by exertional heatstroke have never been reported in prior cases. Case presentation: A 25-year-old Han Chinese man presented with exertional heatstroke with fulminant liver failure, subsequent pulmonary aspergillosis, and extrapyramidal symptoms. Moreover, he also presented with coma, rhabdomyolysis, acute kidney injury, and disseminated intravascular coagulation. He recovered under conservative treatment including therapeutic plasma exchange plus continuous veno-venous hemofiltration, fluid resuscitation, antibiotics, and other support therapy. Conclusions: Therapeutic plasma exchange plus continuous veno-venous hemofiltration could be effective for patients with heatstroke who suffer liver failure and other organ failure. Patients with liver failure are at high risk for pulmonary aspergillosis.

DOI: 10.12890/2017_000695","A healthy 44-year-old man, with a typical presentation of exertional heatstroke, presented with an increase in serum procalcitonin (PCT) levels. Suspecting a coexisting infection, the emergency physician started empirical antibiotic treatment and obtained samples for culture. The antibiotic treatment was stopped immediately after ward admission due to lack of signs of infection. The patient recovered completely after several days of rehydrating therapy and cultures remained negative for bacterial growth. PCT elevation is typically found with heatstroke, but this association is rarely found in daily practice due to the futility of PCT testing in this situation.

DOI: 10.1186/s40560-016-0193-9","Background: Severe heat stroke tends to be complicated with rhabdomyolysis, especially in patients with exertional heat stroke. Rhabdomyolysis usually occurs in the acute phase of heat stroke. We herein report a case of heat stroke in a patient who experienced bimodal rhabdomyolysis in the acute and recovery phases. Case presentation: A 34-year-old male patient was found lying unconscious on the road after participating in a half marathon in the spring. It was a sunny day with a maximum temperature of 24.2Â°C. His medical and family history was unremarkable. Upon arrival, his Glasgow Coma Scale score was 10. However, the patient's marked restlessness and confusion returned. A sedative was administered and tracheal intubation was performed. On the second day of hospitalization, a blood analysis was compatible with a diagnosis of acute hepatic failure; thus, he received fresh frozen plasma and a platelet transfusion was performed, following plasma exchange and continuous hemodiafiltration. The patient's creatinine phosphokinesis (CPK) level increased to 8832IU/L on the fifth day of hospitalization and then showed a tendency to transiently decrease. The patient was extubated on the eighth day of hospitalization after the improvement of his laboratory data. From the ninth day of hospitalization, gradual rehabilitation was initiated. However, he felt pain in both legs and his CPK level increased again. Despite the cessation of all drugs and rehabilitation, his CPK level increased to 105,945IU/L on the 15th day of hospitalization. Fortunately, his CPK level decreased with a fluid infusion. The patient's rehabilitation was restarted after his CPK level fell to <10,000IU/L. On the 31st day of hospitalization, his CK level decreased to 623IU/L and he was discharged on foot. Later, a genetic analysis revealed that he had a thermolabile genetic phenotype of carnitine palmitoyltransferase II (CPT II). Conclusions: Physicians should pay special attention to the stress of rehabilitation exercises, which may cause collapsed muscles that are injured by severe heat stroke to repeatedly flare up.",Case report,1,,34,M,NR,Y,N,CPT II Deficiency,N,N,N,N,NR,Y,N,Athletic,Half marathon (completed),Run,Athletic (Physical Activity/Training/Exercise),Competitive Physical Activity (Athletic/Recreational),21.1,NR,Spring 2016,24.2,54,,,,,,,,40.8,,,,,,,,Pre-Treatment,Y,40.2,Bladder temperature,Hospital admission,NR,EHS,Rhabdomyolysis,Recovered,NR,,Y,,,,,,NR,N,,N,Y,,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,Y,Y,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,301,105945,N,N,N,N,N,Peak CPK: DaY 15,Y,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,N,Y,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,,,,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,,,N,N,N,N,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Y,N,N,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,N,N,N,N,N,Y,Y,Y,N,N,N,N,Y,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,140,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,301,N,110,80,N,N,7.374,95,N,23.7,152,N,N,N,N,13.5,63.43,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,8.6,N,N,N,50,N,N,48.3,N,N,101,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,22,N,N,N,22.1,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,9.3,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,Y,N,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,Y,N,N,Y,Y,,,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,3,N,46,14894,35,14355,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,285,N,N,10.26,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,Y,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,40,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,N,Y,Y,N,N,Y,N,N,Y,N,N,Y,N,N,N,N,N,Y,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,6,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,Y,N,N,N,N,N,Y,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,Y,N,Y,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,210.39,N,N,N,N,27.3,N,N,N,N,N,146,4.3,113,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,40.8

DOI: 10.1249/MSS.0000000000000847","Exertional heat stroke (EHS) occurs in distance runners and is a life-threatening condition. A 30-yr-old healthy recreational male distance runner (CR) collapsed at the 12-mile mark in two half marathon races 6 wk apart in fall 2009. In both episodes, CR was found on the ground confused, incoherent, sweaty, and warm to touch. The emergency medical team responded, and he was treated empirically for suspected EHS by cooling en route to the emergency department. In the emergency department, rectal temperatures were 40Â°C and 40.5Â°C for each episode, respectively. The first race start temperature was 16Â°C with 94% relative humidity (RH), and the second was 3Â°C, 75% RH. Heat tolerance test was within the normal range indicating low EHS risk. A race simulation test (environmental chamber, 25Â°C, 60% RH) at a treadmill pace of 10.5-12.9 kmÂ·h was stopped at 70 min coincident with a rectal temperature of 39.5Â°C.

A 30-yr-old healthy recreational male distance runner (CR) collapsed at the 12-mile mark in two half marathon races 6 wk apart in fall 2009. In both episodes, CR was found on the ground confused, incoherent, sweaty, and warm to touch. The emergency medical team responded, and he was treated empirically for suspected EHS by cooling en route to the emergency department. In the emergency department, rectal temperatures were 40Â°C and 40.5Â°C for each episode, respectively. The first race start temperature was 16Â°C with 94% relative humidity (RH), and the second was 3Â°C, 75% RH. Heat tolerance test was within the normal range indicating low EHS risk. A race simulation test (environmental chamber, 25Â°C, 60% RH) at a treadmill pace of 10.5-12.9 kmÂ·h was stopped at 70 min coincident with a rectal temperature of 39.5Â°C.

DOI: 10.1186/s40779-016-0078-1","Background: Heat stroke is a life-threatening condition with exertional heat stroke occurring frequently among soldiers and athletes. Because of its common occurrence, many military trainees practice preventive measures prior to any activity requiring severe exertion. Although it is said to be common in practice, different presentations of heat stroke are scarcely described in literature. Case Presentation: We describe a case of an exertional heat stroke in a 23-year-old male Sinhalese soldier who developed early changes of renal failure, liver failure and rhabdomyolysis. The patient initially presented with convulsions, delirium and loss of consciousness to an outside health care facility before being transferred to our institution. Conclusion: It is clear that heat stroke does occur in military trainees while preventive strategies are being practiced. It is important for those who provide healthcare to soldiers to provide proper advice on how to identify impending heat stroke prior to any exercises resulting in severe physical exertion. Further, treating physicians should educate all military trainees about preventive strategies.",Case report,1,,23,M,NR,N,Diagnosed with Asymptomatic non-febrile bacterial infection during hospital admission,N,N,N,N,N,NR,N,N,Occupational,Ruck march 14.5km (4h),March,Occupational (Training/Test/Exercise/Course),Military Training (Occupational),0,4h,5/1/15 0:00,30,76,,17,,,,,,,,,,,,,39,Hospital/Clinic Admission,N,,,,40,EHS,"Acute kidney injury, liver failure, and probable rhabdomyolysis",Recovered,NR,,,,,,,,NR,N,,Y,Y,Y,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,Y,Y,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,17700,N,N,N,N,N,N,INitial CPK: DaY 3,Y,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,Y,N,,,,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,,,N,N,N,N,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,N,N,N,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,N,N,Y,N,Y,N,N,,N,N,N,N,Y,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,119,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,115,57,N,N,7.34,N,N,27,N,N,N,N,N,14.6,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,10.2,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,66,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,Y,N,N,Y,,,,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,104,601,114,408,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,N,Y,Y,N,N,Y,N,N,Y,N,N,Y,N,N,N,N,N,Y,Y,N,Y,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,9,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,Y,N,N,N,N,N,Y,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,176.8,N,46,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,39

On admission, she was found to have lactic acidosis, rhabdomyolysis, and acute kidney injury and was treated with cold normal saline and cooling blankets. She subsequently started having abdominal pain and bloody bowel movements. Computed tomography of the abdomen revealed ascending colon thickening. Furthermore, her lab findings showed transaminitis and elevated coagulation parameters.

Given the severe morbidity that can accompany the disease, the immediate management often begins in the prehospital setting. It is important to have not only a comprehensive understanding of the prehospital cooling methods in addition to hospital management strategies, but an understanding of their potential complications as well. Case Report A 32-year-old male presented to a San Antonio hospital in March 2014 with progressive confusion, nausea, nonbloody emesis, and ataxia. Initial presentation was concerning for exertional heat stroke, as the patient was recorded in the field to have a temperature of 42.1Â°C (106.2Â°F). The patient, on arrival to the emergency department, was found to have a core body temperature of 38.1Â°C (100.6Â°F). All active cooling measures were terminated and active rewarming was initiated. Despite adequate resuscitation and rapid identification of the patient's overcorrection in core body temperature, the lowest recorded temperature was 36.0Â°C (96.8Â°F). Why Should an Emergency Physician Be Aware of This ? This case represents the dangers associated with exertional heat stroke, overcorrection of core body temperature, and the potentially lethal complication of afterdrop. It also represents the need for immediate recognition of the condition and initiation of appropriate medical care. Although this patient's clinical outcome was good, the event could have caused serious morbidity or could have potentially been fatal.",Case report,1,,32,M,NR,Y,N,N,N,N,N,N,NR,N,N,Occupational,March 17km (completed),March,Occupational (Training/Test/Exercise/Course),Military Training (Occupational),17,NR,3/1/14 0:00,,,,,,,42.27,,,,,,,,,,,Pre-Treatment,N,,,,40,EHS,Nil,Recovered,NR,,Y,,,,,,NR,N,,N,N,,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,,,,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,,,N,N,N,N,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,N,N,N,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,,,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,Y,Y,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,N,N,Y,N,N,N,N,N,Y,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,Y,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,42.27

DOI: 10.4085/1062-6050-50.12.01","OBJECTIVE: To describe the possible association (pathophysiologic and clinical features) between exertional heat stroke (EHS) and malignant hyperthermia (MH).BACKGROUND: Both EHS and MH are acute and life-threatening disorders. It has repeatedly been shown that EHS can occur in well-trained patients with known MH-associated mutation in the RYR1 gene in the absence of any extreme environmental conditions or extreme physical activity, thereby supporting a possible link between EHS and MH. In this case, a highly trained 30-year-old male athlete suddenly collapsed while running. He had initial hyperthermia (40.2Â°C) and progressive multiple organ failure requiring medical management in an intensive care unit. After he recovered completely, a maximal exercise test was performed and showed an obvious abnormality of oxidative metabolism in muscle; genetic analysis of the RYR1 gene identified a heterozygous missense variation p.K1393R. Consequently, the athlete was given appropriate information and allowed to progressively return to sport competition.DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS: Doping, use of drugs and toxic agents, exercise-associated hyponatremia, exertional heat illness.TREATMENT: Initial management started with the basic resuscitative guidelines of airway, breathing, and circulation (intubation). Cooling, administration of fresh frozen plasma, and intensive rehydration resulted in improvement.UNIQUENESS: To our knowledge, ours is the first description of this MH mutation (p.K1393R) in the RYR1 gene that was associated with exertional rhabdomyolysis involving a dramatic impairment of oxidative metabolism in muscle.CONCLUSIONS: Common features are shared by EHS and MH.

DOI: 10.1016/j.jelectrocard.2014.12.001","Hypothermia and hyperthermia are relatively common clinical conditions that are associated with significant morbidity and mortality, especially if not promptly recognized and treated. Both of these conditions associated with extreme alterations in core body temperatures can be accompanied by alteration in cardiac function, often with manifest EKG changes.

DOI: 10.1080/00913847.2015.1001714","Athletes are often advised to drink in order to â€œfully replace bodyweight lossesâ€ in order to prevent exertional heatstroke (EHS) during exercise in the heat. There is little evidence that â€œdehydrationâ€ in the range experienced by athletes adversely affects thermoregulation or is the exclusive cause of EHS. In contrast it is established that excess fluid intake can cause exerciseassociated hyponatremia (EAH) sometimes associated with encephalopathy (EAHE). As part of a series of experiments to determine optimal fluid replacement during exercise in the heat, we studied a group of exceptionally well-conditioned and heat-adapted members of the South African National Defence Force. A 20 year old male started a time restricted 50 km route-march in a dry bulb temperature that reached 37.5Â°C (WBGT of 33.6Â°C, relative humidity of 85%). Pre-march plasma osmolality, serum [Na+] and total body water measures indicated euhydration. Fluid was available ad libitum and isotonic sports drinks at 5 km intervals. Fluid intake and core body temperature (Tc) were recorded throughout while he was tracked by a global positioning system measuring distance travelled, position and speed. Comparing the total fluid intake of the soldier (12930 mL) to the rest of the participants (mean intake of 9 038 mL) up to 40 km, it is evident that his intake was 3892 mL (approximately 300 mL h-1) more than the mean for group. At approximately 17h14 the soldier was found lying by himself at the side of the route, 2.24 km from the finish point. He passed away the next day in a medical care facility. This tragic event provides the valuable opportunity to present data on the pacing, temperature regulation and fluid consumption of an exceptional athlete during the development of a fatal case of combined EAHE and EHS. Pacing, fluid intake, Tc and environmental condition data are presented for 5km intervals throughout the march. We propose a novel hypothesis on the possible contribution of EAHE to the development of EHS.",Case report,1,,20,M,25.49,Y,N,N,N,N,N,N,Overweight,N,N,Occupational,Time restricted march 50km (47.8km),March,Occupational (Training/Test/Exercise/Course),Military Training (Occupational),47.76,NR,NR,30.9,47.4,26.9,,,,,,,,,,,,,42.6,,Pre-Treatment,Y,42.3,Rectal,Medical tent,42,EHS,Hyponatremia,Passed away,NR,,Y,,,,,,NR,N,,N,N,,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,Y,N,Y,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,Y,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,Y,Y,,N,,,,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,,,N,N,N,N,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,N,N,N,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,120,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,90,60,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,,,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,Y,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,Y,N,Y,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,26,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,Y,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,N,Y,Y,N,N,Y,N,N,Y,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,Y,N,Y,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,N,Y,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,Y,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,120,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,"Serum Na+ measured oN ED admissioN, post treatmeNt iN medical teNt.",N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,42.6

Consequences can be far-reaching, potentially leading to multi-organ failure and possibly death. We discuss the case of a 23-year old army recruit presenting with altered consciousness and hyperthermia after a training march. Following initial clinical improvement, rising CK and liver enzyme levels as well as increasing INR were recorded. Facing the risk of multi-organ failure, the patient was transferred to a specialized ICU. The condition could be stabilized without recurring to molecular adsorbent recirculation system (MARS).

In this setting, fulminant hepatic failure (FHF) occurs as a result of severe hypoxic hepatitis.Case Report We report the case of a young male athlete who developed exertional heatstroke associated with rhabdomyolysis and hypoxic hepatitis while running the final stages of an ultra-marathon (62 km). The patient rapidly developed multiorgan failure, including fulminant hepatic failure, requiring intensive care admission for mechanical ventilation, hemodialysis, and inotropic support. He failed to improve with supportive measures and underwent an emergency hepatectomy followed by orthotopic liver transplant, after which he recovered completely.Conclusions We discuss the rationale for liver transplantation in this setting, possible alternative treatments, and the pathophysiology of fulminant liver failure in this rare case.",Case report,1,,40,M,NR,Y,N,N,N,N,N,N,NR,Y,N,Athletic,Marathon 62km (57km),Run,Athletic (Physical Activity/Training/Exercise),Competitive Physical Activity (Athletic/Recreational),57,NR,NR,29,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,NR,N,,,,NR,EHS,Fulminant hepatic failure,Recovered,NR,,,,,,,,NR,N,,N,N,,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,Y,Y,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,25640,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,,,,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,Y,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,Y,,,,N,N,N,N,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,N,N,N,,,,,,,,,,,,,Y,,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,,,,Y,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,59.77,106.42,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,3.6,24,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,"Peak INR, APTT: DaY 2",N,N,N,N,N,,,Y,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,Y,N,N,Y,,,,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,2884,4900,3600,6384,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,Y,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,N,Y,N,N,N,Y,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,Y,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,Y,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,3,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,Y,N,N,N,N,N,Y,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,Y,N,N,594000,N,N,22,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,

DOI: 10.3109/10903127.2013.864357",Exertional heat illness is rarely encountered by individual EMS providers but can be common in certain settings and events. The notion that significantly altered mental status must accompany elevated core temperature in heat illness may delay recognition and treatment. We report on a series of marathon and half-marathon runners who suffered exertional heat illness during a marathon race in relatively mild conditions. Altered mental status was not uniformly present. All patients were treated in the finish line medical tent and responded well to cooling. More than half were discharged from the medical tent without being transported to the hospital. This case series demonstrates that many runners respond to early identification and treatment of exertional heat illness.

DOI: 10.1186/1752-1947-7-62","Introduction. Little information is available on the pathogenesis of heatstroke without strenuous exercise in younger patients. Here, we report the case of a 31-year-old man who developed heatstroke secondary to hyponatremia. His condition was initially misdiagnosed as classic heatstroke. We hope the detailed description of our patient's case will provide valuable information for medical professionals faced with similar cases in the future. Case presentation. A 31-year-old Japanese man who was regularly taking anti-hypertensive agents, including a thiazide, was admitted to our hospital owing to consciousness disturbance and a high-grade fever. A thorough examination revealed mild renal dysfunction, rhabdomyolysis, a hyper-coagulable state, and severe hyponatremia (114mEq/L). Because he worked in a hot environment, an initial diagnosis of heatstroke was established. His general condition improved rapidly with supportive measures, and he was discharged on the fourth day after admission. Interestingly, he did not recognize feeling hot while working in a hot environment. These findings suggest that the consciousness disturbance, which was probably attributable to acute hyponatremia caused by the thiazide, preceded the onset of the heatstroke. Conclusions: Clinicians should consider the presence of underlying diseases, especially consciousness disturbance, when younger individuals develop heatstroke in the absence of strenuous exercise.

DOI: 10.2169/internalmedicine.52.7645","We here in report the rare case of a 56-year-old man who suffered from heat stroke. Although he was in a coma with convulsions on arrival and developed multiorgan failure, he recovered after two weeks of successful treatments. Hyperintense signals on the right temporoparietooccipital cortex, which disappeared within one week, were demonstrated on diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance images.

DOI: 10.1016/j.annemergmed.2011.11.005","Heat stroke is defined by central nervous system abnormalities and failure of proper maintenance of thermoregulation as a result of high core body temperature ensuing from exposure to high environmental temperatures or strenuous exercise. Common complications include acute respiratory distress syndrome, disseminated intravascular coagulation, acute renal injury, hepatic injury, and rhabdomyolysis. Myocardial injury may also occur during heat stroke, resulting in cardiac enzyme increase and ST-segment changes on the ECG. Such findings might behave as diagnostic pitfalls by mimicking the presentation of coronary artery occlusive myocardial infarction. A previous case report described a patient with heat stroke and ST-segment elevation, in which the definite cause of the ST-segment elevation was unclear; however, acute myocardial infarction caused by coronary artery disease was ruled out according to the clinical signs, serial ECG changes, and serum level of cardiac biomarkers. Stress-induced cardiomyopathy (Takotsubo cardiomyopathy) was suspected, but it could not be confirmed because of the lack of coronary angiography. We herein report a case of heat stroke presenting with ST-segment elevation and cardiogenic shock. Coronary angiography was performed and coronary artery occlusive myocardial infarction was ruled out because of the presence of patent coronary arteries. Left ventriculography showed midventricular and apical hypokinesis, and stress-induced cardiomyopathy was then determined to be the appropriate diagnosis. Heat stroke causes increase of serum catecholamine levels, in which oversecretion and abnormal responses to catecholamines are a possible cause of stress-induced cardiomyopathy.

DOI: 10.1016/j.annemergmed.2011.09.013","Heatstroke is a life-threatening disease; however, no pharmacologic treatment has proven to be effective. In severe cases with multiple organ dysfunction, the mortality remains high and many patients inevitably develop permanent neurologic damage. We report a near-fatal case of exertional heatstroke with multiple organ dysfunction, including generalized convulsions, acute lung injury, and disseminated intravascular coagulation, successfully treated with induced therapeutic hypothermia (33Â°C [91.4Â°F]) by a noninvasive external cooling system. After treatment, the patient completely recovered, without any neurologic sequelae during 1 year of follow-up. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of using therapeutic hypothermia in heatstroke.

DOI: 10.1093/qjmed/hcr160","Any process that substantially diminishes arterial blood flow or arterial oxygen content to the liver can result in hypoxic (ischaemic) hepatitis. 90% of hypoxic hepatitis occurs in unstable patients in intensive care units with haemodynamic failure secondary to heart failure, respiratory failure and toxic shock. The rate of in-hospital mortality in hypoxic hepatitis is very high with studies recording mortalities of 61.5%. It tends to be very uncommon in healthy, young patients with no underlying medical problems. We report here the case of a young healthy athlete who developed heat stroke associated with rhabdomyolysis and hypoxic hepatitis while he was running the final stages of a marathon. The patient required intensive care admission and inotropic support for a few hours after he was admitted with heat stroke. He underwent a rapid recovery after he was resuscitated with fluids. N-acetyl cysteine was also given during the acute stage of the hepatitis. This case highlights an uncommon case of hypoxic hepatitis in a young, healthy patient secondary to hypotension and heat stroke. Inotropic support might have precipitated the hypoxic hepatitis in this young patient. Copyright Â© 2012 S.

DOI: 10.1186/1865-1380-4-12","Exertional heat illness typically occurs over hours in younger athletic patients or military recruits who exercise at elevated temperatures for a sufficient period of time to cause the rate of heat production to exceed the capacity of the body to dissipate heat. Since the physiological response to exercise includes cutaneous vasodilation and sweating, any limitation of such a response can cause rapid hyperthermia and thus heat stroke. One such condition is extensive burns healed by cicatrisation of the skin where the scar and grafted skin surface do not have functional sweat glands and are unable to lose heat in response to high temperatures. The authors report one unique case of a female marathon runner with exertional heat stroke who had recovered from deep second and third degree burns over approximately 50% of her body a few years ago.

DOI: 10.1016/j.wem.2011.01.008","The purpose of this case study is to examine the physiological/behavioral factors leading up to heat exhaustion in a male wildland firefighter during wildland fire suppression. The participant (24 years old, 173 cm, 70 kg, and 3 years firefighting experience) experienced heat exhaustion following 7 hours of high ambient temperatures and arduous work on the fire line during the month of August. At the time of the heat-related incident (HRI), core temperature was 40.1 Â°C (104.2 Â°F) and skin temperature was 34.4 Â°C (93.9 Â°F). His work output averaged 1067 countsÂ·min(-1) (arbitrary units for measuring activity) for the 7 hours prior to the HRI, a very high rate of work over an extended time period during wildfire suppression. In the 2.5 hours leading up to the heat incident, he was exposed to a mean ambient temperature of 44.6 Â°C (112.3 Â°F), with a maximum temperature of 59.7 Â°C (139.5 Â°F). He consumed an average of 840 mLÂ·h(-1) in the 7 hours leading up to the incident and took an average of 24 Â± 11 drinksÂ·h(-1) (total of 170 drinks). The combined effects of a high work rate and high ambient temperatures resulted in an elevated core temperature and a higher volume and frequency of drinking than typically seen in this population, ultimately ending in heat exhaustion and removal from the fire line. The data demonstrate that heat-related incidents can occur even with aggressive fluid intake during wildland fire suppression. Copyright Â© 2011 Wilderness Medical Society. Published by Elsevier Inc.

DOI: 10.1123/jsr.20.2.219","Introduction: Exertional heat stroke (EHS) is a major concern in military trainees performing intense physical exercise, with substantial morbidity rates. Prehospital diagnosis of EHS is essentially clinical. Thus, soldiers, command personnel, and medical staff are taught to recognize this injury and immediately begin aggressive treatment to prevent further deterioration. Patients and Methods: During 2007, 5 otherwise healthy Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) soldiers were diagnosed with EHS while performing strenuous exercise. They were treated vigorously according to the IDF EHS-treatment protocol and were referred to the emergency department. Results: On arrival at the emergency department, physical examination including rectal temperature was unremarkable in all soldiers. Blood and urine workup showed near-normal values. No other medical conditions that could have explained the clinical presentation were found. All soldiers were discharged shortly afterward, with no further consequences. A heat-tolerance test was performed several weeks after the event and was interpreted as normal. All soldiers returned to active service. Conclusion: Because the initial clinical findings were very suggestive of EHS and because no other condition could have explained the prehospital transient hyperthermia, we suggest that these soldiers were correctly diagnosed with EHS, and we propose that rapid vigorous cooling prevented further deterioration and complications. We suggest calling this condition aborted heat stroke.

DOI: 10.1123/jsr.20.2.219","Introduction: Exertional heat stroke (EHS) is a major concern in military trainees performing intense physical exercise, with substantial morbidity rates. Prehospital diagnosis of EHS is essentially clinical. Thus, soldiers, command personnel, and medical staff are taught to recognize this injury and immediately begin aggressive treatment to prevent further deterioration. Patients and Methods: During 2007, 5 otherwise healthy Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) soldiers were diagnosed with EHS while performing strenuous exercise. They were treated vigorously according to the IDF EHS-treatment protocol and were referred to the emergency department. Results: On arrival at the emergency department, physical examination including rectal temperature was unremarkable in all soldiers. Blood and urine workup showed near-normal values. No other medical conditions that could have explained the clinical presentation were found. All soldiers were discharged shortly afterward, with no further consequences. A heat-tolerance test was performed several weeks after the event and was interpreted as normal. All soldiers returned to active service. Conclusion: Because the initial clinical findings were very suggestive of EHS and because no other condition could have explained the prehospital transient hyperthermia, we suggest that these soldiers were correctly diagnosed with EHS, and we propose that rapid vigorous cooling prevented further deterioration and complications. We suggest calling this condition aborted heat stroke.

DOI: 10.4323/rjlm.2010.239","Hyperthermia, characterized by a core temperature of over 40Â°C, occurs when the body's thermoregulatory mechanisms are no longer able to dissipate heat. From a clinical point of view hyperthermia can be of three main types: (1) a consequence of an imbalance between anti and pro-inflammatory agents (usually in septic conditions), (2) heatstroke and (3) malignant hyperthermia. Death caused by hyperthermia, either heatstroke or malignant hyperthermia, is diagnosed at the autopsy mainly using seric, histopathological and imunohistochemical methods. Even though unspectific morphological lesions are found in almost every organ, the most affected are skeletal muscles, gut, kidneys and brain.

DOI: 10.1007/s12328-010-0179-4","We present a previously healthy 38-year-old Japanese man who developed exertional heatstroke (EHS) following a long-distance run and presented with fulminant hepatic failure (FHF) accompanied by a life-threatening flare-up of rhabdomyolysis. Intensive life-supporting medical procedures, including plasma exchange, hemodiafiltration, steroid pulse therapy, and anticoagulant treatment enabled the patient to survive FHF. Initially, his general condition was thought to be improving; however, smoldering rhabdomyolysis suddenly flared up with a marked increase in creatine kinase levels when the dose of steroids was reduced, subsequent to which his condition deteriorated rapidly, eventually resulting in death.

DOI: 10.1016/j.ajem.2008.09.040","We present a previously healthy 38-year-old Japanese man who developed exertional heatstroke (EHS) following a long-distance run and presented with fulminant hepatic failure (FHF) accompanied by a life-threatening flare-up of rhabdomyolysis. Intensive life-supporting medical procedures, including plasma exchange, hemodiafiltration, steroid pulse therapy, and anticoagulant treatment enabled the patient to survive FHF. Initially, his general condition was thought to be improving; however, smoldering rhabdomyolysis suddenly flared up with a marked increase in creatine kinase levels when the dose of steroids was reduced, subsequent to which his condition deteriorated rapidly, eventually resulting in death. The serum levels of interleukin-6 measured retrospectively were found to be markedly elevated and to have fluctuated synchronously with the disease activity.

DOI: 10.1007/s00540-008-0725-0","A 37-year-old man was transferred to our emergency center because of heat stroke with circulatory shock. Despite aggressive body cooling, massive intravenous transfusion, and supply of inotropic agents, shock was persistent. To evaluate adrenal function, an adrenocorticotropic hormone stimulation test was conducted and the results indicated that he had critical illness-related corticosteroid insufficiency (CIRCI) as a result of adrenal insufficiency. Continuous hydorocortisone administration was started and he recovered from shock within a few hours. He was discharged on the thirty-seventh hospital day. Serum cortisol and cytokine concentrations were initially high and the cytokines decreased subsequent to hydrocortisone administration. It is speculated that CIRCI is an exacerbating factor in heat stroke, and hydrocortisone may be a potential therapeutic approach in such patients.

Clinical examination revealed tachycardia and hyperpyrexia (106Â°F). All preliminary investigations were normal. With a diagnosis of heat stroke, rapid cooling was applied with external cooling chamber and intravenous fluids were given to rehydrate the patient. Antipyretics were given per rectally to bring down the temperature. 7 days later, the patient regained consciousness but developed incoordination of movement of all four limbs and slurring of speech.

DOI: 10.4077/cjp.2009.amh060","Here in we report the case of a patient who displayed a classic heat stroke with multiple organ dysfunction and hypercoagulable state resistant to conventional whole body cooling and antipyretic therapy, and necessitating the use of hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) to rescue him from death. A 49-year-old male laborer, suffering from heat stroke syndromes (e.g., hyperpyrexia, seizure and coma, and hypotension), was admitted to an emergency unit of a medical center hospital. The patient displayed multiple organ dysfunction with rhabdomyolysis, hepatic, renal, respiratory, and cerebral dysfunction, and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Both hyperpyrexia and multiple organ dysfunction were resistant to conventional treatment measures. HBOT was adopted to rescue the patient from heat stroke-induced death. Before HBOT, analyses of serum revealed hypercoagulable state or DIC as well as signs of rhabdomyolysis, and renal and hepatic failure. In addition, pulmonary edema, coma, hypotension, and hyperpyrexia occurred. HBOT was used successfully to combat these syndromes and to rescue the patient from heat stroke death. This case suggests that HBOT is useful for treatment of heat stroke with multiple organ dysfunction.

DOI: 10.1249/MSS.0b013e31816a7155","Purpose: Five of 28,753 cyclists participating in an annual 109-km bicycle race died, four within 24 h of the race and the fifth 17 d later. All five deaths were reported to be the consequence of exertional heatstroke. One runner of 6874 participating in an annual 56-km ultramarathon developed heatstroke and required active cooling for 10 h to achieve normothermia. The purpose of this article was to postulate (i) why only 6 of 35,627 athletes were hospitalized for heatstroke in these races, (ii) if exercise alone could have elevated their body temperatures sufficiently to cause heatstroke, and (iii) why the runner required such prolonged cooling. Methods: Clinical and autopsy data are presented for three of the cyclists and the runner for whom access to this information was granted. Calculations were made to predict the work rates necessary to produce their measured rectal temperatures. Results: The rectal temperatures of two of the cyclists were 42.0 and 41.2Â°C on hospitalization, and that of the runner was 41.8Â°C on collapse. Standard calculations showed that in the prevailing environmental conditions and with their exercise speeds, none should have developed exertional heatstroke. The third cyclist experienced a cardiac arrest to which his elevated (rectal) temperature may have contributed. Conclusion: The hyperthermic states experienced by the cases presented may have resulted from failure of their heat-losing mechanisms. Alternatively, they might have resulted from excessive endothermy, triggered by physical exertion and other unknown initiating factors. Excessive endothermy should be considered in cases of heatstroke that occur in mild to moderate environmental conditions. Furthermore, prompt initiation of cooling is crucial in all cases of suspected heatstroke.

DOI: NIL","Purpose: Five of 28,753 cyclists participating in an annual 109-km bicycle race died, four within 24 h of the race and the fifth 17 d later. All five deaths were reported to be the consequence of exertional heatstroke. One runner of 6874 participating in an annual 56-km ultramarathon developed heatstroke and required active cooling for 10 h to achieve normothermia. The purpose of this article was to postulate (i) why only 6 of 35,627 athletes were hospitalized for heatstroke in these races, (ii) if exercise alone could have elevated their body temperatures sufficiently to cause heatstroke, and (iii) why the runner required such prolonged cooling. Methods: Clinical and autopsy data are presented for three of the cyclists and the runner for whom access to this information was granted. Calculations were made to predict the work rates necessary to produce their measured rectal temperatures. Results: The rectal temperatures of two of the cyclists were 42.0 and 41.2Â°C on hospitalization, and that of the runner was 41.8Â°C on collapse. Standard calculations showed that in the prevailing environmental conditions and with their exercise speeds, none should have developed exertional heatstroke. The third cyclist experienced a cardiac arrest to which his elevated (rectal) temperature may have contributed. Conclusion: The hyperthermic states experienced by the cases presented may have resulted from failure of their heat-losing mechanisms. Alternatively, they might have resulted from excessive endothermy, triggered by physical exertion and other unknown initiating factors. Excessive endothermy should be considered in cases of heatstroke that occur in mild to moderate environmental conditions. Furthermore, prompt initiation of cooling is crucial in all cases of suspected heatstroke.

DOI: 10.1123/jsr.16.3.260","Context: Heat illness is the third leading cause of death in athletics and a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in exercising athletes. Once faced with a case of heat related illness, severe or mild, the health care professional is often faced with the question of when to reactivate the athlete for competitive sport. Resuming activity without modifying risk factors could lead to recurrence of heat related illness of similar or greater severity. Also, having had heat illness in and of itself may be a risk factor for future heat related illness. The decision to return the athlete and the process of risk reduction is complex and requires input from all of the components of the team. Involving the entire sports medicine team often allows for the safest, most successful return to play strategy. Care must be taken once the athlete does begin to return to activity to allow for re-acclimatization to exercise in the heat prior to resumption particularly following a long convalescent period after more severe heat related illness.

DOI: 10.7205/milmed.172.6.603","Heat stroke is a rare clinical phenomenon, characterized by systemic heat and cytokine-induced organ damage. Permanent neurological deficits rarely develop following heat strokes, and cerebellar dysfunction predominates among these rare cases. We report a case of severe heat stroke with recovery from severe multiorgan failure but with persistent neurological manifestations. These included a combination of resolving right-sided signs as well as persistent frontal subcortical dysfunction, with minimal, if any, cerebellar involvement. This combination and the absence of cerebellar involvement is an unusual neurological sequelae of heat stroke.

DOI: 10.1186/cc3771","INTRODUCTION: We report the case of a patient who developed a severe post-exertional heat stroke with consecutive multiple organ dysfunction resistant to conventional antipyretic treatment, necessitating the use of a novel endovascular device to combat hyperthermia and maintain normothermia. METHODS: A 38-year-old male suffering from severe heat stroke with predominant signs and symptoms of encephalopathy requiring acute admission to an intensive care unit, was admitted to a ten-bed neurological intensive care unit of a tertiary care hospital. The patient developed consecutive multiple organ dysfunction with rhabdomyolysis, and hepatic and respiratory failure. Temperature elevation was resistant to conventional treatment measures. Aggressive intensive care treatment included forced diuresis and endovascular cooling to combat hyperthermia and maintain normothermia. RESULTS: Analyses of serum revealed elevation of proinflammatory cytokines (TNF alpha, IL-6), cytokines (IL-2R), anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-4) and chemokines (IL-8) as well as signs of rhabdomyolysis and hepatic failure. Aggressive intensive care treatment as forced diuresis and endovascular cooling (CoolGard and CoolLine) to combat hyperthermia and maintain normothermia were used successfully to treat this severe heat stroke. CONCLUSION: In this case of severe heat stroke, presenting with multiple organ dysfunction and elevation of cytokines and chemokines, which was resistant to conventional cooling therapies, endovascular cooling may have contributed significantly to the reduction of body temperature and, possibly, avoided a fatal result.",Case Report,1,,38,M,24,Y,N,N,N,N,N,N,Normal,N,N,Recreational,Hiking tour (NR),Hike,Recreational (Physical Activity/Training/Exercise),Physical Activity/Sport (Recreational),NR,NR,7/1/03 0:00,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,40.8,,,Hospital/Clinic Admission,N,,,,40,EHS,Multiorgan dysfunction,Recovered,NR,,Y,,,,,,NR,N,,N,N,,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,Y,Y,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,102.4,33124,N,N,N,N,"MYoglobiN: DaY 2

DOI: 10.1536/ihj.46.543","We document serial changes in the electrocardiogram (ECG) and myocardial markers in a case of severe heat stroke treated with cooling procedures. A 23-year-old comatose male with heat stroke was presented in the emergency room. The condition of the patient was complicated by hepatic failure, rhabdomyolysis, acute renal failure, and cardiac abnormalities. ECG revealed diffuse ST-T elevation; serum levels of myocardial markers were remarkably high and diffuse hypokinesis was observed on the echocardiogram. Cooling procedures, including applying cold vapor to the patient's skin, a gastric lavage with cold water, and an intravenous cold fluid infusion were not successful. Since multiple organ damage (heart, liver, central nervous system, and kidney) was evident, we utilized continuous hemodialysis and hemofiltration, using cold dialysate for efficient cooling. The patient recovered from the multiple organ damage and was removed from the intensive care unit 14 days after the onset. The cardiac abnormalities had normalized within several days without any damage to the myocardium. Q waves were not detected in any lead in the ECG. When interpreting ST-T elevation in the ECG of a heat stroke patient, caution should be used so as to not misdiagnose it as an acute myocardial infarction.

DOI: 10.1016/j.resuscitation.2004.09.013","Endotoxemia has been reported as a mechanism for the fatal sequela after heatstroke. Subsequent disseminated fungal infection in a heatstroke patient has been also described. Beta-d-glucan, a constituent of the fungal cell wall, is an early diagnostic measure for fungal infection. In a heatstroke case, we examined for the first time levels of serum beta-d-glucan and endotoxin. A 34-year-old man with a body temperature of 43.5Â°C was admitted in a state of shock. Prior to the development of disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (DIC), a remarkable elevation of serum beta-d-glucan level to 116 pg/mL (normal level < 6.0 pg/mL) was revealed on the first day of admission. However, serum endotoxin was not detected when using a method that excluded beta-d-glucan contamination from endotoxin measurement (normal level < 1.0 pg/mL). This change of beta-d-glucan level was accompanied by a depressed neutrophil function, especially in phagocytosis of 34% (normal range 70-90%) but not in bacterocidal function (81% versus a normal range of 70-100%). After intensive care including continuous hemodiafiltration, the patient regained consciousness but remained ataxic due to cerebellar infarction, which might have resulted from DIC, and subsequent bilateral fungal oculitis were revealed 45 days after admission. This case report demonstrates the elevation of serum beta-d-glucan but normal endotoxin levels after heatstroke, which may prompt further study to re-examine the serum levels of endotoxin in such catastrophic insults.

DOI: 10.1007/s00134-004-2312-7","Background: Exertional heat stroke (EHS) is a life-threatening condition caused by an extreme elevation in core body temperature. Hepatic involvement is one of the hallmarks of heat stroke, affecting nearly all heat stroke patients. It is usually manifested by increased serum levels of liver enzymes, but acute liver failure has also been reported. Liver transplantation has been proposed as a potential treatment in cases of severe liver failure, but there are no unanimous criteria pointing to the right stage in which to conduct the transplantation. Case presentation: We report a case of an 18-year old patient who suffered heat-induced liver failure. The patient was referred for orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) but spontaneously recovered completely with conservative treatment. Conclusions: This case demonstrates the complexity of the decision for liver transplantation in EHS. The various prognostic criteria of acute hepatic failure and their relevance to EHS are critically reviewed, with an aim to assess their application for such a condition.

DOI: 10.1097/00042737-200310000-00013","Acute hepatic failure is a rare complication of exertional heatstroke with poor prognosis. We herein report a 24-year-old man presenting with acute hepatic failure and rhabdomyolysis following exertional heatstroke during hard physical work on a construction site. Acute hepatic failure occurred after 2 days and led to massive impairment of coagulation parameters. On day 3 after heatstroke the patient fulfilled standard criteria for emergency liver transplantation (i.e. the 'London criteria' and the 'Clichy criteria') but was not transplanted. Nevertheless liver function improved spontaneously thereafter and the patient recovered completely within 12 days. In contrast, the outcome of emergency liver transplantation was dismal in three cases of exertional heatstroke in the literature. Thus conservative management appears to be justified in heatstroke-associated liver failure even in the presence of accepted criteria for emergency liver transplantation.

The military physician diagnosed a 19-year-old military recruit from an elite unit to have exertional heat stroke. Immediate treatment in the field with rapid ice water cooling and vigorous fluid administration resulted in pulmonary edema. Transthoracic echocardiography on admission to the emergency department revealed moderate reduction in left and right ventricular function. After treatment, within a few days, rapid myocardial recovery was noted and persisted after 6 months of follow-up. Possible mechanisms of cardiac dysfunction in exertional heat stroke and treatment strategies are discussed.

DOI: 10.1093/qjmed/hcg029","Background: Although vasoactive substances may be important in the pathogenesis of some types of acute renal failure (ARF), their potential role in exertional heat stroke (ExHS) with ARF has not been explored. Aim: To evaluate whether changes in concentration of individual vasoactive mediators correlated with alterations in renal function and haemodynamics in patients with ExHS and ARF. Design: Prospective case-control study. Methods: Systemic and renal haemodynamics, circulating vasoactive hormones and urinary vasodilator metabolites were determined in 12 military recruits who developed ExHS with ARF but without other organ failure during a three-year period. The control group consisted of 12 recruits who performed similar exercise under the same conditions without developing ExHS. Results: There were significant elevations in circulating pressor hormones (catecholamines, renin, aldosterone and endothelin-1 (ET-1)) and significant decreases in the vasodilatory hormone prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) in the acute phase of ExHS with ARF when compared to ExC. There was also a significant rise in nitric oxide metabolites (NOx) in the acute phase of ExHS. All of these abnormalities in circulating hormones returned to normal range during the recovery phase of ExHS. The ERPF correlated positively with GFR and urinary PGE2 and negatively with plasma catecholamines, renin, ET-1 and NOx.

DOI: 10.1093/qjmed/hcg029","Background: Although vasoactive substances may be important in the pathogenesis of some types of acute renal failure (ARF), their potential role in exertional heat stroke (ExHS) with ARF has not been explored. Aim: To evaluate whether changes in concentration of individual vasoactive mediators correlated with alterations in renal function and haemodynamics in patients with ExHS and ARF. Design: Prospective case-control study. Methods: Systemic and renal haemodynamics, circulating vasoactive hormones and urinary vasodilator metabolites were determined in 12 military recruits who developed ExHS with ARF but without other organ failure during a three-year period. The control group consisted of 12 recruits who performed similar exercise under the same conditions without developing ExHS. Results: There were significant elevations in circulating pressor hormones (catecholamines, renin, aldosterone and endothelin-1 (ET-1)) and significant decreases in the vasodilatory hormone prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) in the acute phase of ExHS with ARF when compared to ExC.

DOI: 10.1093/qjmed/hcg029","Background: Although vasoactive substances may be important in the pathogenesis of some types of acute renal failure (ARF), their potential role in exertional heat stroke (ExHS) with ARF has not been explored. Aim: To evaluate whether changes in concentration of individual vasoactive mediators correlated with alterations in renal function and haemodynamics in patients with ExHS and ARF. Design: Prospective case-control study. Methods: Systemic and renal haemodynamics, circulating vasoactive hormones and urinary vasodilator metabolites were determined in 12 military recruits who developed ExHS with ARF but without other organ failure during a three-year period. The control group consisted of 12 recruits who performed similar exercise under the same conditions without developing ExHS. Results: There were significant elevations in circulating pressor hormones (catecholamines, renin, aldosterone and endothelin-1 (ET-1)) and significant decreases in the vasodilatory hormone prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) in the acute phase of ExHS with ARF when compared to ExC.

After heavily working for hours at a construction site during a heat wave, the 28-year-old male presented with 41.4Â°C body temperature and multiorgan failure, consisting of neurological impairment, rhabdomyolysis, acute renal failure, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). In the first week there was no evidence of infection. Treatment included cooling, aggressive volume resuscitation, administration of antithrombin-III concentrates and steroids. The patient survived and recovered normal neurological, renal, respiratory and haematological function, and no disability persisted. This case illustrates survival and complete recovery after multiorgan failure in heat stroke with vigorous intensive care. Treatment with antithrombin and steroids and may well have contributed to the favourable outcome.

Cases were selected from among hikers who requested medical help from the National Park Service Emergency Medical Service (EMS) or who presented to the medical clinic on the rim of the canyon with complaints related to exercise in the heat. Of 44 patients who had serum samples analyzed, 7 had hyponatremia with clinically significant symptoms and serum sodium levels < 130 mmol/L: 3 had grand mal seizures, 2 had other major central nervous system disorders, and 2 had minor neurological symptoms. Seizures and change of mental status distinguished hyponatremia, (P = 0.0002). Indirect evidence suggests that hyponatremic patients were hyperhydrated. Other common symptoms included nausea, vomiting, headache, and dizziness, but these symptoms did not predict the level of serum sodium. When exercise in the heat is prolonged, hyponatremia is suggested either by altered mental status or by seizures without hyperpyrexia or hypoglycemia. No mortality or long-term morbidity occurred in any of these cases of hyponatremia.",Case Series ,7,,50,F,NR,Y,N,Diabetes,Glipizides [Antidiabetic Agent]; Levothyroxine Sodium [hyroid Hormone Replacement]; Conjugated Estrogens [Estrogen Replacement Therapy],N,N,N,NR,N,N,Recreational,Hiking at Grand Cayon (NR),Hike,Recreational (Physical Activity/Training/Exercise),Physical Activity/Sport (Recreational),NR,NR,31 May - 31 Sep 1993,41.1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,NR,N,,,,NR,OTHER,Hyponatremia,Recovered,NR,,,,,,,,NR,N,,N,N,,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,Y,N,N,N,N,N,,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,Y,,,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,,,N,N,N,N,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,N,N,N,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,68,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,120,90,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,,,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,Y,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,Y,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,28,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,Y,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,Y,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,9,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,Y,N,Y,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,117,3.9,84,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,1.005,609,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,

Cases were selected from among hikers who requested medical help from the National Park Service Emergency Medical Service (EMS) or who presented to the medical clinic on the rim of the canyon with complaints related to exercise in the heat. Of 44 patients who had serum samples analyzed, 7 had hyponatremia with clinically significant symptoms and serum sodium levels < 130 mmol/L: 3 had grand mal seizures, 2 had other major central nervous system disorders, and 2 had minor neurological symptoms. Seizures and change of mental status distinguished hyponatremia, (P = 0.0002). Indirect evidence suggests that hyponatremic patients were hyperhydrated. Other common symptoms included nausea, vomiting, headache, and dizziness, but these symptoms did not predict the level of serum sodium.

DOI: 10.1128/JCM.37.8.2656-2662.1999","A 21-year-old woman suffered heatstroke and developed diarrhea while trekking across south Texas. The heatstroke was complicated by seizures, rhabdomyolysis, pneumonia, renal failure, and disseminated intravascular coagulation. The patient's stool and blood cultures grew Campylobacter jejuni. The patient subsequently developed paranasal and gastrointestinal zygomycosis and required surgical debridement and a prolonged course of amphotericin B. The zygomycete cultured was Rhizopus schipperae. This is only the second isolate of R. schipperae that has been described. R. schipperae is characterized by the production of clusters of up to 10 sporangiophores arising from simple but well-developed rhizoids.

DOI: NIL","Heat stroke, which is also known as ""sun stroke,"" is a medical emergency, and fatalities can occur unless it is diagnosed early and treated efficiently. Heat stroke may manifest quite suddenly, giving little time to differentiate it from extreme physical exhaustion in collapsed subjects. It is also known to lead to serious disseminated intravascular coagulation. Sudden death in a young female is presented who collapsed after trekking in a hilly, jungle area in Malaysia on a warm, humid day. She had joined a weight reduction programme a few weeks earlier. She was found collapsed and in a semiconscious state in the jungle by her groupmates and was taken to hospital. On admission she was unconscious, hyperpyrexic, with rapid, thready pulse and a low blood pressure. Biochemical studies revealed metabolic acidosis, elevated liver and cardiac enzymes and impairment of renal function. Her coagulation profile was found to be impaired and she started bleeding through the mouth and nostrils. She also developed watery diarrhoea and initially a septicaemic condition, including acute enteritis was suspected. Despite active treatment, her condition deteriorated and she died eight hours after admission. Autopsy confirmed a generalised bleeding tendency, with pulmonary, oesophageal and gastrointestinal mucosal haemorrhages. Flame-shaped subendocardial shock haemorrhages were seen in the interventricular septum on the left side of the heart. The findings support a diagnosis of heat stroke. Various aspects related to heat stroke, the autopsy diagnosis and its prevention are discussed.",Case Report ,1,,30,F,29.56,Y,N,N,Slimming tea [Herbal Supplement],N,N,N,Overweight,N,Not conditioned/Undertrained,Recreational,Jungle trekking (1.5h),Jungle Trek,Recreational (Physical Activity/Training/Exercise),Physical Activity/Sport (Recreational),NR,1.5h,NR,,,,,,,,,,40,,,,,,,,Hospital/Clinic Admission,Y,39.5,Axillary,Post-initial treatment ,39,EHS,"metabolic aciodsis, acute liver injury, cardiac abnormalities, impaired renal function",Passed away,NR,,,,,,,,Hypohydrated,Y,,N,N,Y,N,Y,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,Y,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,Y,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,Y,N,N,N,,N,,,,,,N,N,N,Y,N,N,N,N,Y,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,,,N,N,Y,N,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,N,N,N,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,140,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,1.71,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,Y,N,N,,,,,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,Y,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,Y,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,Y,Y,N,N,N,Y,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,Y,Y,Y,N,Y,N,N,N,Y,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,Y,N,N,N,N,N,N,Y,N,N,N,Y,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,Y,N,N,N,N,Y,N,N,N,N,N,N,Y,N,N,N,N,N,N,Y,Y,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,Y,N,N,N,N,,,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,Y,N,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,Y,N,N,N,N,N,Y,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,Y,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,Y,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,40

Outcome measures: Clinical and biochemical parameters during illness and postmortem pathological findings. Results: Patient died 5 days after presentation with exertional heatstroke from the complications of acute renal failure and acute hepatic failure, the latter unrecognized until the terminal stages. Conclusion: Liver injury is a common accompaniment of exertional heatstroke; fulminant hepatic failure is a rare complication.

DOI: 10.3109/08860229209039120","The effect of excessive heat accumulated in the body is life threatening. It could damage not only body fluid electrolyte hemoeostasis, but kidney, liver, and hematologic function. The example reported herein was a Thai laborer, previously healthy, 32 years of age. He joined the tricycle race from Chiang Mai to Lumpoon, which is about 30 km. The tournament was held on a late morning of high humidity and a temperature of 35Â°C. After biking 25 km, he began having heavy perspiration and suffered from severe myalgia and high fever. He suddenly lapsed into unconsciousness and fell down. He was admitted to the Lumpoon Hospital because of convulsions, and 2 days afterward, anuria, anemia, thrombocytopenia, coagulopathy, and liver impairment were detected. He was later transferred to the Faculty of Medicine for further intensive treatment. Lab analyses showed marked azotemia (BUN 96 mg%, Cr 10.6 mg%), elevation of muscle enzyme (CPK > 1000 U/L, SGOT > 650 U/L), liver failure (SGPT > 650 U/L, DB/TB = 23.0/30.0 mg%) and disseminated coagulopathy; platelet 17,000/mm3, PT 51.1 sec (control 12.5), and PTT 73.5 sec (control 37.7). He was treated with bicarbonated hemodialysis trice weekly. Blood-exchange transfusion was performed 3 times during the first 2 weeks with 10 units of fresh whole blood in each exchange.

DOI: 10.1093/milmed/155.3.116","Heat stroke is a medical emergency characterized by sudden loss of consciousness and by failure of the heat-regulating mechanism, as manifested by high fever (usually above 104Â°F) and cessation of sweating. Fatality rates for patients with heat stroke can vary from 0% to more than 40%. Immediately after heat stroke has occurred or is suspected, aggressive cooling measures should be initiated. This case illustrates a 24-year-old commissioned officer who developed heat stroke while running in PT formation dressed with shorts and a T-shirt. Although this patient was in good shape and the wet bulb was only 74.4Â°F, he developed the classic symptoms of heat stroke, with a core temperature of 105.9Â°F. He further developed hepatic and skeletal muscle enzyme abnormalities (SGOT, 4680; CPK, &27; LDH, 821) with hyposphosphatemia (0.8). This patient had no significant risk factors, and after the appropriate treatment, his enzyme abnormalities returned to normal without sequelae.

We report the cases of two heat stroke victims, one of whom developed pulmonary edema and the other, peripheral edema. In both, RVG demonstrated dilatation and diffuse hypokinesis of the right ventricle, which persisted for several weeks. We conclude that the heart may be involved in heat stroke and that heart failure is a potential complication of the syndrome that can have a prolonged subclinical course. Fluid replacement in heat stroke should be done under careful observation, which may be facilitated by noninvasive assessment of cardiac function.",Case Report ,1,Israel,28,M,NR,Y,N,N,N,N,N,N,NR,N,Unacclimitised,Occupational,Dustman work (NR),Physical Work/Labour,Outdoor Occupational (Physical Work/Labour/Agriculture Work/Farm Work),Outdoor Physical Work (Occupational),NR,NR,NR,30,90,,,,,43,,,,,,,,,,,Hospital/Clinic Admission,Y,38,Unspecified ,Post-initial treatment ,NR,EHS,Disseminated fusarium infection,Passed away,NR,,Y,,,,,,NR,N,,N,N,,N,Y,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,Y,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,4800,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,N,Y ,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,,,,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,Y,N,Y,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,,,Y,N,N,N,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Y,Y,N,,,,,,,,,,,,Y,,,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,16.4,N,N,N,69,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,12,N,N,N,N,44,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,1,N,N,N,N,240,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,Y,N,N,Y,,,,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,655,N,345,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,Y,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,Y,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,N,Y,N,N,N,Y,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,Y,N,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,Y,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,246,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,Y,N,N,43

Thirteen other males completed HA without indications of either heat intolerance or heat exhaustion. Because Mr. A. responded normally to HA on days 1-4, the intervention of an unknown host factor on days 5-8 was suggested. Mr. A.'s heat exhaustion episode (day 8) was apparently forewarned by loss of body weight and increased Î”HR, Î”Tsk (days 5-8) and Î”Tre (days 7-8) during daily 90-min trials. His symptoms indicated classical salt depletion heat exhaustion, but the calculated salt deficit (<0.1 g NaClÂ·kg-1 body weight) was mild. Post-heat exhaustion serum enzyme levels were either normal (ALT, AST) or acutely elevated (CPK). Blood beta-endorphin and cortisol levels were six times and two times greater than control values, respectively.

DOI: 10.1093/milmed/150.12.657","This paper reports qualitative findings from a larger study of medical unit personnel participating in a three day simulated chemical warfare field training exercise. Behavioral and biopsychological responses of personnel are described. Data collection strategies included participant observation and semi-structured interviews.

DOI: 10.1136/bmj.287.6397.948","Death after marathon running has a long history. Reports of fatal heat stroke appear regularly from other countries, particularly Australasia and North America, and documented cases have occurred in environmental temperatures as low as 10Â°C. We report the first case in Britain and suggest measures for prevention and initial treatment. To prevent heat stroke races should be held at a suitable time and season. Competitors should be trained, acclimatised, and able to recognise early symptoms. They should know the risk factors and should not run if unwell. Adequate hydration before, during, and after the race is essential, as this case report shows. Spotters should be deployed along the route to identify exhausted runners and emergency facilities provided to cool patients. Rapid reduction of core temperature and maintenance of cardiac output are essential in the immediate management of heat exhaustion.

DOI: 10.7759/cureus.17053","Herein, we present a case of heatstroke encephalopathy with abnormal brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) signals. A 19-year-old man lost consciousness  while working outdoors when the temperature was 35Â°C. His Glasgow Coma Scale  score at presentation was E1V1M1, and his body temperature was 39Â°C. Chest  computed tomography revealed bilateral infiltrates, and tests for urinary  pneumococcal antigens were positive. He was diagnosed with heatstroke preceded by  pneumococcal pneumonia. He was subsequently treated with antibiotics, and body  surface cooling was performed. A diffusion-weighted brain MRI performed on day  eight revealed abnormal bilateral hyperintensities from the cortex at the frontal  lobe apex of the subcortex. Moreover, he had reduced spontaneity, dysarthria,  nystagmus, tremor, and ataxia of both the upper limbs. He was diagnosed with  heatstroke encephalopathy. On day 28 since admission, the abnormal MRI signals  disappeared. Subsequently, the patient's spontaneity improved, but his other  neurological dysfunctions persisted.

EHI can involve multiple  organs of the body, including the muscles, kidneys and brain; however, myocardium  involvement is infrequent. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We present the case of a  26-year-old male construction worker who worked outdoors in a hot arid  environment. He presented with acute kidney injury and rhabdomyolysis and was  diagnosed with EHI. During his hospital stay, he developed complete heart block,  and cardiac MRI showed features of myocarditis. Work-up to identify other  aetiologies of myocarditis was normal. This case highlights the effects of EHI on  the myocardium. CONCLUSION: It is important to keep in mind the various effects  of EHI on the myocardium. Myocarditis due to EHI is rare, and conduction defects  resulting from it might persist, necessitating specialist intervention.

DOI: 10.1155/2012/924328","Objective. The case of a patient who developed a fatal post-exertional heat stroke is reported. Case Report. A 20-year-old man with a history of morbid  obesity, hypertension, and schizophrenia was admitted to our intensive care unit  because of multiorgan failure due to severe heat stroke. He had been working  under the sun. Treatment included aggressive body cooling but, in spite of the  best supportive care, the patient succumbed in a few hours. We concluded that the  adverse event was possibly associated with his obesity and the use of  antipsychotics. Histological evaluation revealed lesions consistent with severe  hyperthermia and shock. Conclusions. Heat stroke is an uncommon clinical entity  characterized by systemic heat and loss of the body's normal mechanisms for  dealing with heat stress, such as sweating and temperature control. When heat  stroke is diagnosed early and supportive care begins promptly the prognosis is  optimal but it becomes a life-threatening disease when treatment is delayed. Lack  of physical acclimatization and the use of certain medications that interfere  with salt and water balance can impair thermoregulation under conditions of high  environmental temperature.

Which stage to perform the liver  transplantation for severe hepatic failure in EHS is still obscure at clinical  setting. The conservative management has been reported to be successful in  treating heat-stroke-associated AHF even in the presence of accepted criteria for  emergency liver transplantation. Case Presentation. Here, we reported a  35-year-old male who presented with very high transaminases, hyperbilirubinemia,  significant prolongation of the prothrombin time, and coma. No other causes for  AHF could be identified but physical exhaustion and hyperthermia. Although the  current patient fulfilled London criteria for emergency liver transplantation, he  spontaneously recovered under conservative treatment including intravenous  fluids, cooling, diuretics as mannitol, and hepatocyte growth-promoting factors.

He suffered from acute  renal failure and rhabdomyolysis and proceeded to acute liver failure (ASAT  6100â€‰U/l and ALAT 6561â€‰U/l) due to hypoxic hepatitis on day 3. He did not meet  criteria for emergency liver transplantation and recovered on supportive care.  CONCLUSIONS: Acute liver failure due to heat stroke is a life-threatening  condition with often delayed onset, which nevertheless resolves on supportive  care in the majority of cases; thus, a delayed referral to transplant seems to be  reasonable.",Case Study,1,Israel,25,M,NR,Y,N,Austism,Treated for possible UTI during hospital admission,N,N,N,NR,N,N,Recreational,Run 10km (completed),Run,Recreational (Physical Activity/Training/Exercise),Physical Activity/Sport (Recreational),10,NR,2018,28,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,41.1,Pre-Treatment,Y,38.6,tympanic,hospital admission,,EHS,acute liver failure and rhabdo,Recovered,NR,,Y,,,,,,NR,N,,N,N,,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,Y,Y,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,842,15969,N,4.7,55,N,N,peak CPK: day 3,Y,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,Y,Y,,,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,,,Y,N,N,N,,,,,,,,,,,,,Y,,,,,,,Y,N,N,,,,,,,,,,,,,Y,,,,N,N,N,N,Y,N,N,,N,N,N,N,,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,130,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,129,98,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,18.8,N,N,N,90,18.2,N,N,N,N,59.4,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,1.11,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,Y,N,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,Y,N,N,Y,,,,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,Y,Y,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,0.3,2.4,48,6100,26,6561,21,150,N,86,N,N,N,N,N,N,16,56,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,Y,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,45,98,,N,Y,N,Y,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,N,Y,N,N,N,Y,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,3,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,GCS 15 hospital admissioN,Y,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,Y,N,N,N,Y,N,N,N,,N,Y,N,N,N,N,N,N,Y,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,Y,N,N,N,N,N,195,195,N,9.7,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,145,4.1,N,N,N,2.8,N,N,N,0.22,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,"LeukocYte aNd erYthrocYte casts as well as bacteria

When disaster teams from metropolitan hospitals were introduced in 1983,  it became apparent that skilled staff members, despite their lack of experience  in the resuscitation of combative heat casualties, could carry out the  established procedures and protocols effectively and efficiently.",Case Study,1,Israel,41,M,NR,Y,N,N,N,N,N,N,NR,N,N,Occupational,Working in hot environment (NR),Physical Work/Labour,Outdoor Occupational (Physical Work/Labour/Agriculture Work/Farm Work),Outdoor Physical Work (Occupational),NR,NR,NR,,,,,,,42,,,,,,,,,,,Hospital/Clinic Admission,N,,,,NR,EHS,Nil,Recovered,NR,,Y,,,,,,NR,N,,Y,N,,N,Y,,N,N,N,N,N,N,Y,N,Y,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,Y,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,3300,3860,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,Y,N,,,,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,,,N,N,N,N,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,N,N,N,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,N,N,Y,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,105,50,N,N,7.22,N,N,38,89,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,-11,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,Y,,,,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,268,319,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,Y,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,42.5,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,Y,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,Y,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,Y,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,Y,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,Y,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,6.9,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,,,,,,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,42

Mild hepatic involvement is often observed in these patients; however, fulminant  liver failure may occur in approximately 5% of all cases. Liver transplantation  is a potentially curative approach for exertion-induced liver failure, although  there is a lack of consensus regarding the criteria and optimal timing of this  intervention. CASE SUMMARY: This paper describes 5 patients (4 men and 1 woman)  who were referred to the department where this study was performed with the  diagnosis of exertion-induced acute liver failure. Three patients underwent liver  transplantation, 1 recovered spontaneously, and 1 patient died on day 11  following the exertion.

DOI: 10.1186/s40696-015-0010-3","BACKGROUND: The common practice in the Israel defense Forces is that exertional heat related injury patients undergo a heat tolerance test 6-8Â weeks post event  as part of the ""return to duty"" process. In the case of a positive heat tolerance  test the individual is classified as heat intolerant, in some cases however, the  thermoregulatory recovery may be longer (several months), and therefore a second  heat tolerance test is scheduled 6-8Â weeks later. The presented case reports  emphasize the possibility of different recovery periods of the thermoregulatory  center and the distinction between congenital and acquired physiological heat  intolerance. CASE DESCRIPTION: Two young healthy males (A and B) were diagnosed  with exertional heat related injury during a pre-recruitment sorting process.  Both underwent a heat tolerance test, and were found heat intolerant. During the  next months they repeated the test several times. Patient A was finally diagnosed  as heat tolerant and patient B was diagnosed as heat intolerant.

DOI: 10.1186/s40696-015-0010-3","BACKGROUND: The common practice in the Israel defense Forces is that exertional heat related injury patients undergo a heat tolerance test 6-8Â weeks post event  as part of the ""return to duty"" process. In the case of a positive heat tolerance  test the individual is classified as heat intolerant, in some cases however, the  thermoregulatory recovery may be longer (several months), and therefore a second  heat tolerance test is scheduled 6-8Â weeks later. The presented case reports  emphasize the possibility of different recovery periods of the thermoregulatory  center and the distinction between congenital and acquired physiological heat  intolerance. CASE DESCRIPTION: Two young healthy males (A and B) were diagnosed  with exertional heat related injury during a pre-recruitment sorting process.  Both underwent a heat tolerance test, and were found heat intolerant. During the  next months they repeated the test several times. Patient A was finally diagnosed  as heat tolerant and patient B was diagnosed as heat intolerant. CONCLUSION:  Susceptibility to heat is a significant determinant for active young people such  as athletes and soldiers. Both cases emphasize the importance of the heat  tolerance test (and repeated test when needed) as a criteria for an exertional  heat related injury patient to return to duty/play and to perform intense  physical activities.

The onset was marked by sudden loss of consciousness, sometimes preceded briefly by irrational behavior. All but 1 were profusely sweating at the time of collapse. Body temperatures, examined after a variable delay, exceeded 40[degree]C in all but 4. Diarrhea, vomiting, convulsions, and hypotension were common during the 1st few hr. The course during the 12 hr. after collapse made apparent whether the heat injury was fatal, severe, or mild. Seven fatal cases were unconscious, except for brief lucid intervals, until their deaths within 65 hr. These showed severe disturbances in blood coagulation. In the 12 severe cases unconsciousness lasted an average of 5-1/2 hr. and never exceeded 10 hr. These patients evidenced hepatic and renal damage, elevation of many serum enzymes, and disturbances of clotting mechanism. All survived, frequently after a stormy course and sometimes with neurological residua. The 8th fatal case, actually 1 of severe heatstroke, succumbed on the 31st day to renal and hepatic failure. In the 16 mild cases unconsciousness never exceeded 3 hr. and in the majority was less than 1 hr. Evidence of other system involvement was transient. The body temperature frequently fell spontaneously. Therapy included rapid cooling (under cover of sedation to prevent convulsions and shivering); management of water and electrolyte imbalance; the use of fresh blood and plasma to correct clotting defects; and hemodialysis in 2 cases. Autopsy findings were uniform in all cases and consisted of multiple petechiae in numerous organs and grosser hemorrhages, congestion, and widespread cellular degeneration. Heatstroke occurs when elevated body temperature becomes a cellular noxin. The body temperature rises when the heat load exceeds the capacity of the heat-dissipating mechanisms. In these cases the critical role of the increased metabolic heat (physical exertion) in overwhelming a normal heat-dissipating mechanism, as evidenced by profuse sweating, is demonstrated. In the setting of physical exertion in hot weather, the collapse with fever of a previously healthy individual should a priori be diagnosed as heatstroke, unless another cause is obvious.

He was initially thought to have sustained a head injury and was markedly dehydrated.  He suffered severe disseminated intravascular coagulation and gross neurological, renal and hepatic disturbances.Intervention and outcome:  He required repeated haemodialysis, assisted ventilation and supportive therapy and remained unconscious for 10 days.  He then Recovered fully.Conclusion:  Heat stroke is potentially fatal and can be easily mistaken for head injury in contact sports.

Their case notes were studied and compared. Heat-stroke cases numbered 49; of these only 2 were admitted in 1965, a male and a female who Recovered completely, the other 47 (35% of the admitted cases) were all males and were seen in 1960.
